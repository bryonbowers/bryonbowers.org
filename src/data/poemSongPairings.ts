    poemExcerpt: 'Shot by cupid, mind gone stupid...',
    poemContent: `our bodies entangled…
pressed hard…
black camaro warm against my back
eyes and lips locked
gas fumes and you
breathing into me…
electric hands roaming into…
white washed jeans
my eyes dart
looking for church elder eyes…
I rush to get gas in the car
before my reputation is blown

your wildness sliding down..
claws digging into me
Pleasant pain in my neck
overcome by your ferocity…
There's a thin line
Between you and me
Is it attraction or insanity

my mind was stupid
and slowed around you
down to a dull drum
your body on me…
my pulse on your thumb…
pounded in my head
you a feral cat
me your scratching post

Had to gather my thoughts
Get you back in the car
Put it in gear
We wouldn't drive far
The night was young
and we were free
Your body was tight
Wrapped around me…

Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupid
A feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…`,

Your Apartment
After School
Your Cigarette Breath
Attacking my mouth
Your Legs Flowing
Out your Underwear
You said you liked girls too
I Didn't care

I got lost Downtown
You gave me directions
When I finally found
What you were looking for
You slammed me down hard
On that shag green floor
Next day and Next
I Came back
For more
We kept it between us
In school we were strangers
I didn't know you
You didn't know me

You called me up…
You said let's talk
I asked 'about what
You said just come over
You were moving away
One more time for the road
I lingered a bit…
You said enjoy your youth
Your Apartment was darker
When I left that day
I'd miss you…
But not that breath…

Your Cigarette Breath…
Attacking me After School…
You gave me Downtown Directions..
To a Lovely Carpet Burn…
We were Strangers…
In a Dark Apartment…
Lingering with you…
One Last Time…`,

No longer standing
Lives the ghosts of college past
A blonde bombshell…
Wakefulness Fading fast…
Leans back in her office chair
Purchase orders sprinkled everywhere
stamps the paper
licks the stamp
a little longer than necessary…

Life moves and shuffles us along
Like kayakers in the ocean
With a great white on our tail
If you stop paddling
you're bound to fail

Love when you can
Stretch often
Sleep under the stars at least once in your life
Give and you receive in life…
and in bed…
Walk without an umbrella
Get soaked in the rain…
Insert a little random
Into your daily routine
The mind craves anomalies
and delicious food
Be nice
Don't be rude

Youth is wasted on the young
Wisdom wasted on the old
Or so I'm told
If you can help it
Don't get old
drink the elixir of immortality
called contentment
love is kinda like the universe
It's unlimited`,

lips pursed as you talked…
you were shy…

you told me of california
and your fashion design
I've forgotten my words
my brain was preoccupied
we watched the game
but I really only watched you
my hands usually knowing
didn't know what to do

your grama said don't date me
on her death bed she did

pin pals, electric

keyboard surfers at night
words our exchange

before you gave me your body

Lord Byron and old Cook books
My only company
A thousand spices
A hundred jellies and jams
Laid before them
For their morning delight…

Morning steam coming off the water
Just me and the Alligators
Swimming in the lake
Before the people come
And bring their eyes
And their minds reaching out

Can see the nervous…
the sad…
the clueless…
the hurt…
and the happy…
eyes lit up dancing in the water…
I was the observer
riding through the busy bodies
Onto the arcade
Ninja Turtles, X-men, and a burger

Blueberry pancakes
From the giant freezer
In the restaurant kitchen
While grama chats with the cook
Sleepy ride home…
peppermint in my mouth…
Drinking Ice cold tranquility…
perfect bliss at the end of a summer day…
All my adventures I did relay…
Wilson Phillips tugging the heart strings…
Aaron Neville's Louisiana
Melts me into sleep…`,

of knitting needles
reached inside
and pulled out the lion's aching tooth
simplicity, elegance, demure
with a touch of aloof
a kind heart
with music eyes
and a new mustache
two young people
a glimpse of future's past
rolling around
a fluffy brown couch
as they planned their escape
children poured
from every corner
everyone around them
long into the thick of it
Halloween hangovers
and to do lists in their heads…

Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion's mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again

a delicious feast before them
prepared by the goddess of war
and cherished friends
warriors of the species
the skeleton bride hands out mushrooms
while green crystals fall from trees of sound
he plays on the beach with wild abandon
not a care in the world…
while Igor and Dr Frankenstein's grand daughter
regal my mind of Bradbury tales of old
stories flowing of dwarves and jars
horror movie of youth floats up
one twin dies
the other takes his place
twin brain floating in a jar
inside and abandoned old barn

Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion's mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again

the goddess of elegance sits beside me
with her tequila silence
and thoughts of things to do
as the children watch spirits of machines
wonder a world of killer machines
Fine dining
on a Michelin star
Chicago skyline
after the fire beauty arose
humanity flexing its mind muscle
built of cattle proceeds nexus powers
and a world connected
goodbyes said
we close the door
the goddess and our two loves
fall into a slumber
an elf toils
love is strange
colt 45
a great growler with a banjo
spits out lead belly cobain lost pines
into my mind
as darkness comes in
and thoughts dance to a slow stop
on these pages of your time …

You were so small
You could fit in my armpit
You were my first kid
I was your shepherd herder
2 acres of land to roam
You stayed pretty close to home
Except for that one time….
You wondered to the neighbor's house
Faced down 3 dobermans
And lived to bark about it…

You were the world's
worst hunting dog
And the world's best feet warmer
Always curled up at my feet
Woke me up every morning
Licks to the face
Nestled to neck

Left you to go to college
You moved to Florida with grama and grampa
You passed away
Never got to say goodbye
When I heard I cried…
Not a manly stoic cry
But the sobbing bubbly cry…
of a father losing his son…

Goodbye my Fritzy
Goodbye my first little one
Goodbye my little armpit warmer…

a better place
missing your lips
the taste of you in the dark

a raw hunger within my body
needs you
warm waters now cold
cold waters turned tired and old…
the way you put your hands on your hips
the purse of your lips
hands explore
my body does implore
of you more

you are gone to my world
ceramic orange glow…
melting eyes into face
I can still feel your fingers
dancing like helium ballerinas
across the hairs of my arm
a nibble on the ear
wrapped up in you
your control complete over me…

at the edge of the Universe..

heat on his face

Eating some bread…
Drinking some wine…

twinkle in an eye
happiness bubbling under the surface

Mating on the backbone
Death soon in their eyes…

Injected into our veins

get off as soon as you can

You need help around the house

extra pair of hands

I smiled at you
you chuckled at first
I smiled again
got my smile returned

My eyes danced on you
As I raked your yard
Back inside your house..
Air conditioner on…
Ice Tea sitting…
On your table cloth…
Sweating like crazy…

People standing 'round her

Snot dripping from their nose
Tears from their eyes

water drips into the crevasses of the mind
as ants crawl onto my brain,
nibbling little chunks of grey matter.
the sadness over her absence keeps me company
like an angry child wanting to go out and play
on a rainy day.
thunder roars somewhere nearby,
giving me the illusion of something bigger than myself.

The absence of this one hurts....
It hurts in the pit of my stomach
It hurts at the bottom of my throat.

this one nurtured me;
this one looked after me;
this one spoke to me like I mattered
this one lived life in intervals of her children
this one watched basil grow and tea leaves dry.
while her heart grew only to die

As she lay dying on the hospital bed;
her children and children's children stand around her
holding her hand
her still healthy brain; trapped in a body gone bad;
fires synapses of 82 years lived

we have to let this one go
I have to let this one go
alone in my thoughts
no more talking
she's sleeping now
no.... she is no more
only in our thoughts, our memories
the absence of this one hurts....
some pain can never go away.`,

answered…
water and you floating on me…

voice echoes through me…

birthday suits on…

and so was he
you were sliding by
hurried look in your eye…

as moments passed by…

To scream at the sky

You shrugged when she died…
A youth of smiles
Now only angry eyes
Basic conventions
You refused To comply…

She tried her best
To mold you for the world
She's even angry with you
In my memory
They poked and probed
At your changing mind
Just to see what they could find
You were a swinging pendulum
Flattened to a stationary rock
By the doctor's medicine

She's gone now
But we're still here
I tried, I really did
But I failed
Had to come up for air
You had to swim on your own
Rips my heart apart
I couldn't help you
Maybe some day
We'll meet up again
At some point on the ocean's surface
Where there are no rip tides
pulling us down…`,

on a hot Texas day
got my church clothes on
confession comin' my way…
Voices risin'
filling up my ears
don't see no god
Taking' way my fears
Been lookin' hard
For all these years…

Your angel eyes
Locked in on me
One evil root
Climbing' up my tree
You take off your Angel crown
I'll put on my Devil's Suit

white robes flowin'
pageantry on a lovely day
thinking of ringing your bell
in that very special way
your knowing angel eyes
smiling back at me
holy spirit coming out
same mouth it came on in

Your angel eyes
Locked in on me
One evil root
Climbing' up my tree
You take off your Angel crown
I'll put on my Devil's Suit

Tabernacle day
Your body sways down the line
Hair bobbin' side to side
gotta drink that blood
talk about that flood
water's comin' comin' down
your finger stopping' at the tip
stopping' there to linger

Your angel eyes
Locked in on me
One evil root
Climbing' up my tree
You take off your Angel crown
I'll put on my Devil's Suit`,

on shifting sands…
anger in the space between
Our sheets and hands
transactions on the passive aggressive love exchange…
one from you
one from me
Now there's two
Shall we make it three?...
poked…
then kissed the beast…
it roared a bit
then takes its seat
let's have a truce
between your anger
and my absence
here this night
you pour the wine
I'll cut the bread
while you get the love dip…
you bite my lip
while I take a sip
your anger…
a drink served smooth and cold
your body…
a dish served hot on a winter night…
perfect compliments…
beasts within emerge
inner smile on the verge
as we speak without words
slow words on ears
slow words on tops
words flow to the top of the mountain
then ski down its slopes
brains no longer bogged down
worries blocked out of mind
grasped you with power
words held hard to tongue
words spoken soft of secrets
soft atop your body
whispered cold hot wind…
while anger and absence battle it out
a winter storm wind flows between us
heavy...
rain…
sleet..
and snow…
now your love…
Is all i know…
escape hatches all deployed…
secret tunnels all destroyed…
now I poke the beast
and here I will sit
waiting patiently
waiting for you to destroy me….
while i take a sip…
and enjoy the trip
…
…
i poke the beast sometimes for fun
i poke the beast…
then i run…
anger to love
then back again…
i poked the beast this time...
I did not win...
so i sit waiting with joy knowing it is me she will destroy`,

    poemContent: `I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they're floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender
One more round…

I disappear from the world
when it gets too much
People drain me of my powers
they like to talk and such
I like a good book
Solitude is my solace
Like to dive deep down
In the ancient past
I could just lay down
In the water and drown
Sumerian Clay tablet
Laying on the ground
One of many
Never found…

I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they're floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender
One more round…

Mystery coalition
Of Sea people attack
Egypt fights back
On those nile shores
King rises up
In 20 years he is gone…
Bronze Age Collapse
The weather's gone bad…
Assyrian Empire
Knowledge lost
Buildings crumbling in the wind
two factions battled it out
But Nobody won in the end…
Somebody's gonna rise up again…
Civilization lost
People fighting over power, food, and water
Make that cost minuscule
Then the people
They can rule…

I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they're floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender
One more round…`,

    poemContent: `Red scarf around your neck
One fingerless glove on
Adverse to haste
Your destination is Unknown
A dancer and a dreamer
15 minutes late
No breakfast
On your plate
just a cereal bar
on the ride in dad's car

It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…

Ham and PBJ
In your lunchbox
Everyday
You're a fish in water
and a Butterfly on the land
Guardian of the creatures
Protector of your little brother
Worried about everything
More than you should be
Everything's gonna be ok
just enjoy your day

It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…

Swimming in the pool with dad
Playing the Dragon Game
Holding on for dear life
Trying to keep feet on the other side
Marco said to Polo
Where did you go go?
Time to get out
Bed time comes
Can't turn it off?
I'll read a poem for you..
The Sun fell out of the sky
The moon began to cry
It cried so hard
A thunderstorm formed…
Rain came down so hard
and so long
That a river formed
And turned into this song
And flowed all the way
to your ears…
sleep now
get your rest
let me take care of the rest…

It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…`,
