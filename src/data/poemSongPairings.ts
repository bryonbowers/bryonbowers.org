    poemExcerpt: 'Shot by cupid, mind gone stupid...',
    poemContent: `our bodies entangled…
pressed hard…
black camaro warm against my back
eyes and lips locked
gas fumes and you
breathing into me…
electric hands roaming into…
white washed jeans
my eyes dart
looking for church elder eyes…
I rush to get gas in the car
before my reputation is blown

your wildness sliding down..
claws digging into me
Pleasant pain in my neck
overcome by your ferocity…
There's a thin line
Between you and me
Is it attraction or insanity

my mind was stupid
and slowed around you
down to a dull drum
your body on me…
my pulse on your thumb…
pounded in my head
you a feral cat
me your scratching post

Had to gather my thoughts
Get you back in the car
Put it in gear
We wouldn't drive far
The night was young
and we were free
Your body was tight
Wrapped around me…

Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupid
A feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…`,

Your Apartment
After School
Your Cigarette Breath
Attacking my mouth
Your Legs Flowing
Out your Underwear
You said you liked girls too
I Didn't care

I got lost Downtown
You gave me directions
When I finally found
What you were looking for
You slammed me down hard
On that shag green floor
Next day and Next
I Came back
For more
We kept it between us
In school we were strangers
I didn't know you
You didn't know me

You called me up…
You said let's talk
I asked 'about what
You said just come over
You were moving away
One more time for the road
I lingered a bit…
You said enjoy your youth
Your Apartment was darker
When I left that day
I'd miss you…
But not that breath…

Your Cigarette Breath…
Attacking me After School…
You gave me Downtown Directions..
To a Lovely Carpet Burn…
We were Strangers…
In a Dark Apartment…
Lingering with you…
One Last Time…`,

No longer standing
Lives the ghosts of college past
A blonde bombshell…
Wakefulness Fading fast…
Leans back in her office chair
Purchase orders sprinkled everywhere
stamps the paper
licks the stamp
a little longer than necessary…

Life moves and shuffles us along
Like kayakers in the ocean
With a great white on our tail
If you stop paddling
you're bound to fail

Love when you can
Stretch often
Sleep under the stars at least once in your life
Give and you receive in life…
and in bed…
Walk without an umbrella
Get soaked in the rain…
Insert a little random
Into your daily routine
The mind craves anomalies
and delicious food
Be nice
Don't be rude

Youth is wasted on the young
Wisdom wasted on the old
Or so I'm told
If you can help it
Don't get old
drink the elixir of immortality
called contentment
love is kinda like the universe
It's unlimited`,

lips pursed as you talked…
you were shy…

you told me of california
and your fashion design
I've forgotten my words
my brain was preoccupied
we watched the game
but I really only watched you
my hands usually knowing
didn't know what to do

your grama said don't date me
on her death bed she did

pin pals, electric

keyboard surfers at night
words our exchange

before you gave me your body

Lord Byron and old Cook books
My only company
A thousand spices
A hundred jellies and jams
Laid before them
For their morning delight…

Morning steam coming off the water
Just me and the Alligators
Swimming in the lake
Before the people come
And bring their eyes
And their minds reaching out

Can see the nervous…
the sad…
the clueless…
the hurt…
and the happy…
eyes lit up dancing in the water…
I was the observer
riding through the busy bodies
Onto the arcade
Ninja Turtles, X-men, and a burger

Blueberry pancakes
From the giant freezer
In the restaurant kitchen
While grama chats with the cook
Sleepy ride home…
peppermint in my mouth…
Drinking Ice cold tranquility…
perfect bliss at the end of a summer day…
All my adventures I did relay…
Wilson Phillips tugging the heart strings…
Aaron Neville's Louisiana
Melts me into sleep…`,

of knitting needles
reached inside
and pulled out the lion's aching tooth
simplicity, elegance, demure
with a touch of aloof
a kind heart
with music eyes
and a new mustache
two young people
a glimpse of future's past
rolling around
a fluffy brown couch
as they planned their escape
children poured
from every corner
everyone around them
long into the thick of it
Halloween hangovers
and to do lists in their heads…

Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion's mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again

a delicious feast before them
prepared by the goddess of war
and cherished friends
warriors of the species
the skeleton bride hands out mushrooms
while green crystals fall from trees of sound
he plays on the beach with wild abandon
not a care in the world…
while Igor and Dr Frankenstein's grand daughter
regal my mind of Bradbury tales of old
stories flowing of dwarves and jars
horror movie of youth floats up
one twin dies
the other takes his place
twin brain floating in a jar
inside and abandoned old barn

Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion's mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again

the goddess of elegance sits beside me
with her tequila silence
and thoughts of things to do
as the children watch spirits of machines
wonder a world of killer machines
Fine dining
on a Michelin star
Chicago skyline
after the fire beauty arose
humanity flexing its mind muscle
built of cattle proceeds nexus powers
and a world connected
goodbyes said
we close the door
the goddess and our two loves
fall into a slumber
an elf toils
love is strange
colt 45
a great growler with a banjo
spits out lead belly cobain lost pines
into my mind
as darkness comes in
and thoughts dance to a slow stop
on these pages of your time …

You were so small
You could fit in my armpit
You were my first kid
I was your shepherd herder
2 acres of land to roam
You stayed pretty close to home
Except for that one time….
You wondered to the neighbor's house
Faced down 3 dobermans
And lived to bark about it…

You were the world's
worst hunting dog
And the world's best feet warmer
Always curled up at my feet
Woke me up every morning
Licks to the face
Nestled to neck

Left you to go to college
You moved to Florida with grama and grampa
You passed away
Never got to say goodbye
When I heard I cried…
Not a manly stoic cry
But the sobbing bubbly cry…
of a father losing his son…

Goodbye my Fritzy
Goodbye my first little one
Goodbye my little armpit warmer…

a better place
missing your lips
the taste of you in the dark

a raw hunger within my body
needs you
warm waters now cold
cold waters turned tired and old…
the way you put your hands on your hips
the purse of your lips
hands explore
my body does implore
of you more

you are gone to my world
ceramic orange glow…
melting eyes into face
I can still feel your fingers
dancing like helium ballerinas
across the hairs of my arm
a nibble on the ear
wrapped up in you
your control complete over me…

at the edge of the Universe..

heat on his face

Eating some bread…
Drinking some wine…

twinkle in an eye
happiness bubbling under the surface

Mating on the backbone
Death soon in their eyes…

Injected into our veins

get off as soon as you can

You need help around the house

extra pair of hands

I smiled at you
you chuckled at first
I smiled again
got my smile returned

My eyes danced on you
As I raked your yard
Back inside your house..
Air conditioner on…
Ice Tea sitting…
On your table cloth…
Sweating like crazy…

People standing 'round her

Snot dripping from their nose
Tears from their eyes

water drips into the crevasses of the mind
as ants crawl onto my brain,
nibbling little chunks of grey matter.
the sadness over her absence keeps me company
like an angry child wanting to go out and play
on a rainy day.
thunder roars somewhere nearby,
giving me the illusion of something bigger than myself.

The absence of this one hurts....
It hurts in the pit of my stomach
It hurts at the bottom of my throat.

this one nurtured me;
this one looked after me;
this one spoke to me like I mattered
this one lived life in intervals of her children
this one watched basil grow and tea leaves dry.
while her heart grew only to die

As she lay dying on the hospital bed;
her children and children's children stand around her
holding her hand
her still healthy brain; trapped in a body gone bad;
fires synapses of 82 years lived

we have to let this one go
I have to let this one go
alone in my thoughts
no more talking
she's sleeping now
no.... she is no more
only in our thoughts, our memories
the absence of this one hurts....
some pain can never go away.`,

answered…
water and you floating on me…

voice echoes through me…

birthday suits on…

and so was he
you were sliding by
hurried look in your eye…

as moments passed by…

To scream at the sky

You shrugged when she died…
A youth of smiles
Now only angry eyes
Basic conventions
You refused To comply…

She tried her best
To mold you for the world
She's even angry with you
In my memory
They poked and probed
At your changing mind
Just to see what they could find
You were a swinging pendulum
Flattened to a stationary rock
By the doctor's medicine

She's gone now

I tried, I really did
But I failed
Had to come up for air
You had to swim on your own

I couldn't help you

At some point on the ocean's surface
Where there are no rip tides

Locked in on me

Climbing' up my tree

pageantry on a lovely day

holy spirit coming out

Locked in on me

Climbing' up my tree

Your body sways down the line
Hair bobbin' side to side
gotta drink that blood
talk about that flood
water's comin' comin' down
your finger stopping' at the tip
stopping' there to linger

Locked in on me

Climbing' up my tree

Before the Devil… serves his wrath
She Sold her soul for a "Yes Ma'am"... and a "Please"

Kids crawling on the roof and running by the pool
actin' up in school acting a fool
She said "where do I sign?"
"On the front or behind?"
He said, honey here's a token of appreciation
For the parent occupation
smoke it up now get your mind wow
'cause the fires of hell are gonna ring your bell

All of a sudden
As she pleaded on her knees
Kids started listening
Saying "Yes Ma'am" and "Please"
Pickin' up their dishes
Coverin' their mouth when they sneeze
She done sold her soul
For a "Yes Ma'am" and a "Please"

you pour the wine
I'll cut the bread

you bite my lip
while I take a sip
your anger…
a drink served smooth and cold
your body…
a dish served hot on a winter night…
perfect compliments…
beasts within emerge
inner smile on the verge
as we speak without words
slow words on ears
slow words on tops
words flow to the top of the mountain
then ski down its slopes
brains no longer bogged down
worries blocked out of mind
grasped you with power
words held hard to tongue
words spoken soft of secrets
soft atop your body
whispered cold hot wind…
while anger and absence battle it out
a winter storm wind flows between us
heavy...
rain…
sleet..
and snow…
now your love…
Is all i know…
escape hatches all deployed…
secret tunnels all destroyed…
now I poke the beast
and here I will sit
waiting patiently
waiting for you to destroy me….
while i take a sip…
and enjoy the trip

i poke the beast sometimes for fun
i poke the beast…

anger to love
then back again…

I did not win...

A thunderstorm formed…
Rain came down so hard

Took your toy Millennium Falcon
On a trip to another galaxy

A fountain
The 4th of July
And the rest of our lives

She came in from California
On a cold November night

The hockey game was crowded
All the fans were acolytes

Your voice came in a whisper
The only thing I heard

Hot dogs and nachos fall to the floor
I can't think anymore

Our eyes locked as we were leaving
Hardly know you but I need you

I thought it be forward to ask you for your email
So I asked my uncle to ask your brother

You went back to California
I really missed you

1am chats on yahoo messenger
On a dialup connection

We talked about everything
We talked about nothing

I logged in everyday
To see what you would say

We fell in love on the phone line
I knew your heart was all mine

I was a wild horse roaming,
She was a flower just blooming.

Tamed to a lover's nest
We all know the rest

Now its 1am diaper changes
Exhausted midday exchanges

Family cuddles on the bed
The dog's butt is by my head

Kids are growing up too fast
If I can only make it last

Time is not your friend
Just try to hold his hand
As long as you can
Cause one day
He'll be falling in love on the phone line
Losing his heart to his Valentine

We got married in India
on a Humid December Day
We got married again in Texas
on a Cold Hill Country Night
Then we did it again…
On the San Francisco Bay…
With a baby on the way…
The Town hall lady
Said "where are your vows?"
Said "we've done this twice before
Many years ago"
We gotta catch the ride
to Embarcadero…

Then years later…
On a busy afternoon
Utility company called…
4th time married on the Phone…

She said "Do you young man?
Give this lovely young woman
Access to your…
Utility account?"
I said
"Yes, I do
With all of my heart
As long as she turns off the lights…
When she leaves a room…"
Then she said:
"Do you young lady?
Take Responsibility?
For paying for all of this guy's
Electricity?"
Then my love said..
"Yes, I do…
I do love you..
But when my feet get cold…
Don't leave me out to dry..
Get under the covers…
Kick that dog off the bed…
And keep my feet warm…

The other voice on the phone said
"I now pronounce you legally bound
By the power
Of your
Electric Line"
Expect a Bill in the mail…

They say 3rd Time's a charm
I say 4th is even better!

far away from the world

Some horses and sheep
And some peaches we'll keep

sending ripples to the slaughter

Summer passes way too quickly
Ice cream drips down really sticky

Where are you napkins
Where did you go
I'm lost without you
I need you so

Sundown sparks a toothbrush tantrum,
Fears of drills and masks to ransom.
Tales of needles, numbing dread,
Dance like shadows round their bed.

Made of Fragile eggs and Christmas elves
Live life well knowing much of what you do disappears along with you

on a rainy day.
thunder roars somewhere nearby,
giving me the illusion of something bigger than myself.

She is laying on the bed…
Iodine soaked toes…
There are thoughts in her head…
nobody knows…
People standing 'around her
Sobbing their goodbyes…
Snot dripping from their nose
Tears from their eyes
Treasure your pain

The absence of this one.....
The absence of this one hurts....
It hurts in the pit of my stomach
It hurts at the bottom of my throat.

this one.
this one nurtured me;
this one looked after me;
this one spoke to me like I mattered in a world of occasionally chaotic routine;
this one lived life in intervals of her children; all her children;
this one watched basil grow and tea leaves dry.
while her heart grew only to die

The grayness of her hair...
so gray it was blue;
was frosting on top of a legacy of the era of her youth
the era of perms, station wagons, disco, and roller skating.
She gave so much of herself;
the pain of a diminishing heart caused anger
anger that manifested as jabs to those she loved
to those with a lack of absence to make the heart grow fonder.

her husband, the guardian of all that is quiet,
sat in the shadow of blindness....
with a patience that would rival a 1000 year old turtle
a turtle the size of a pyramid.

As she lay dying on the hospital bed;
her heart kept beating only by an impromptu pace maker
clinging to her heart like a tick
her children and children's children stand around her
holding her hand

her still healthy brain; trapped in a body gone bad;
fires synapses of 82 years lived
what thoughts she has
nobody knows

her iodine soaked feet poke out of the sheet
tears and snot of those standing fall to the hospital floor

I try not to cry
but there is no controlling it
i can't stop the pain
the loss, the loss of my mom
not of blood, but of life

we have to let this one go
I have to let this one go
alone in my thoughts
no more talking
she's sleeping now

no....
she is no more
only in our thoughts,
our memories

the absence of this one hurts....
some pain can never go away.`,

It was a Toy Blood Bath
Only the toughest did survive
A boy grows up
Ambitions they arrive
A snapshot of his mind
Innocence left behind
Time marches on…
Calls you on the phone
Says "leave my toys alone…"

As the trash bag of forgotten toys
Makes its way to the landfill
A boy's heart remembers
long ago epic battles
and shifting alliances
Blood spilt over
Invisible Dragon Eggs
Labs with secret mummies
crawling out of the goo

It was a Toy Blood Bath
Only the toughest did survive
A boy grows up
Ambitions they arrive
A snapshot of his mind
Innocence left behind
Time marches on…
Calls you on the phone
Says "leave my toys alone…"`,

"Got my thrill on blueberry hill"
Playing' on the radio
Mr. Gobble does side willies
On his school bus show..

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me

Bus packed like sardines
You always sat next to me…
Your smile was contagious
Your pinches made me blush
Playful eyes locked
You were flirting with me

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me


You were older and funny
You made cloudy days sunny
We saved our straws for spit balls
On the ceiling and the walls
Sunflower seeds all over the floor
Older kids talking' to you
Trying to get your number and score

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me


Last day of school
Bus pulled over
Water balloon fight in the park
Your wet t-shirt clinging to you
My blue jeans just got smaller
And I think i just got taller

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me

You moved away that summer
I didn't even know
Got onto the bus that morning
You didn't show
That's ok, people they come
And then people tend to go
Welcome to Mr. Gobble's
Final School Bus Show

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me

[Fade Out]

Bus packed like sardines
You always sat next to me…
Your smile was contagious
Your pinches made me blush
Playful eyes locked
You were flirting with me

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin' brown eyes
and Big ol' dimples
Sittin' next to me`,

    poemContent: `You had glasses and a pigeon toe
Joined the show for her
But fell in love with you

Wrote letters to you that summer
Expressing my undying love
You never responded

Summer ended, school was back
You walked in wearing all black
You were a freshman, I was a sophmore
your mom said no dating til 16
think your mom liked me
She just didn't like us
I didn't fuss
so I fell into love tornados
Left you sitting on the stage

Back stage glances
On stage kisses
Requiem for a Dream
We made a good team
I was a wanderer
A jester of random thoughts
travelling and chasing the world
By the time you turned 16
we were in the same world
but living different lives

I still think about those glasses
that cute pigeon toe
My undying love inked on a letter in my best hand writing
licking that dry stamp
dropping it in the mailbox
Imagining you reading it and responding in kind
then I remember leaving you
On that stage for the last time
Our last Show we did
Our last onstage kiss
And our last back stage glance`,

Time is an evil sweet mistress
Bringing you love and death
she's stealing' a piece of you
With every breath

Like hot sauce on a summer day
Or ice cream on a cold winter night
Sometimes your mind's at bay
Sometimes it never feels quite right

[Chorus]

Cold wind on an April morning
Birds singing' wake up babies
World's outside
It's Waiting for you
The Universe doesn't
Know what to do
If it doesn't
Include me with you

[Chorus]

I've been working' everyday
Waiting for that free time to come to me
Pretty sure everybody's running as fast
Feel like I should be
Having' a blast
But the old man
In the back of my brain
Is making some days
Look like rain

[Chorus]

Pitter Patter of feet
On the east texas street
Skeleton demons pushing baby buggies
Winking as they go by
Pink Floyd playing on the radio
Beer in his hand before he goes

On the Barn Room Floor…
Red Canned tomatoes…
Lining every wall…
Saw you climbing
Then I Heard you Fall…
My Heart was pumping
Your Eyes wide open…
Ran So Hard…
Bloody Feet never touched the floor…

[Chorus]
Blood on the Floor
Attacked by a hinge
On the barn room door
Jumping over fences
Leaping over ditches
That gumball's gonna
give you stitches

Shiny Gumball machine
Sitting' at the top of the barn room stairs
Pennies in our pockets
Sneaking like ninjas
Get those gum balls
Put em in our mouth
Chew 'em for a minute
Then spit 'em out…
Then onto the next one
Rinse repeat…

[Chorus]

You were superman
Climbing on the door
That door hinge
Your kryptonite
When you fell
You didn't fall right...
Blood was flowing
From your knee
Adrenaline pumping
Through me
My inner brain
Taking the reins
I started running…
Jumping Barbed Wire Fences…
In single bounds..
Bird in my mouth
I was a Royal..
Hunting hound

[Chorus]

They sewed you up
Gumballs and all
We were Supermen
Playing with kryptonite Toys…
Two wild and wandering Boys…
Throwing shotgun shells
Into Fire barrels
Playing with Giant Snapping Turtles
and Copperhead Snakes
Dancing Barefoot
In the rain
Damn, did we feel alive!
It's a wonder we survived!
