Putrid and OOzing 
Into every pore
Flies Circling ‘around
Spit mixed with tissue
As they rested on you…
She wanted to stop
And observe
I reluctantly complied…

[Chorus]
Dead fish on the beach
Maggots a feasting 
My lover fascinated 
with your smelly decay
When I eat fish
I see her strange smile
To this day

Laying on the beach that last time
Raw before the world
Your body exposed to the elements
Birds taking turns
Taking you away
One bird got your left eye
Another one got your right..
A crab just ran off
With your tail

[Chorus]
Dead fish on the beach
Maggots a feasting 
My lover fascinated 
with your smelly decay
When I eat fish
I see her strange smile
To this day

The ocean’s forces taking you
Dark tide of the night comes…
Deeper into the water
Your scales falling onto the sand…
Eager Ocean fish 
Nibbling at your body
As you float away
Down deeper 
To the ocean’s depths

[Chorus]
Dead fish on the beach
Maggots a feasting 
My lover fascinated 
with your smelly decay
When I eat fish
I see her strange smile
To this day
