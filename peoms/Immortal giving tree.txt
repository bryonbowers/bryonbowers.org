I remember the first time I read you
you were hanging out 
with the tv guide
I saw a tree with little apples
and a stump at the end
It started kinda fun
just a tree talking to a boy
then i saw you start to disappear
giving yourself to him
a greedy boy
wanting one more toy
you gave him ladders to joy
In a world demanding more of him
you gave him means
to leave you all alone
the sense of loss so overwhelming
Tears rolled down
sprinkled onto the paper…
from a long dead tree
a story old as time…
The boy now an old man
rested his tired bones on you
his time in this world over due…
I read you to my kids
In their younger days
now I don't read to them
They've started reading
Their own stories…
Quietly in their heads
Someday they’ll read it to their kids
Then theirs to theirs
I'll be a stump long gone…
But you will still be here
red, then red, then red again…
