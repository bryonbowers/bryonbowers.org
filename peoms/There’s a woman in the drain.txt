There’s a woman in the drain Yes she’s gone quite insane Her tryfulls are not inane She struggles with the Pain. Long ago lost her soul  To the Clown King’s Reign Prays before every exchange  for her soul to remain… [chorus] Can the Bulwark hold? Yes, I am told By the honor and convention of old Liberty’s soul  Is getting sold Liberty for Sale to the Shark and to the whale  It’s not Arbi-Trajj It’s a Tear-Riff Mir-Raj 3rd Term opening’ up a can of worms Feeding them to his Minions in tiny Sold-my-soul portions [chorus] Can the Bulwark hold? Yes, I am told By the honor and convention of old Liberty’s soul  Is getting sold He’s dismantling’ love He’s shooting’ all the doves Targeting Immigrants, Tourists and anyone who dares to disagree He’s a dog of an angry pedigree Ripping’ up the constitution Spreading’ his Hate pollution [chorus] Can the Bulwark hold? Yes, I am told By the honor and convention of old Liberty’s soul  Is getting sold Water filling up Slowly to the top Open the Drain Welcome the Pain now you must swim only to his whim Swim Lady Swim…. Only to Him….
