I don't look up 
at the clouds anymore…
or the stars 
shining in the dead of night
rain comes down
feeding a thirsty ground
worms are crawling….
crawling all ‘round…
dirty shoes laying
on white solid stone…

[chorus]
I am still 
I see you there
can not move
I can not care…
I close my eyes
and fly away…
to a world
where I can stay
on an island 
far away…..

crinkle Lectric in air
heavy smell in my nose…
darkness light ‘round the edge
clouds can’t choose day from night…
floating heavy
water underside
water coats it all
I can hear it fall
I can see you standing
standing by the road
I can see you listening…
listening to what is told…
child now old…
sinking down to you…
in the cold soft ground…

[chorus]
I am still 
I see you there
can not move
I can not care…
I close my eyes
and fly away…
to a world
where I can stay
on an island 
far away…..

dirt now in my ears…
your voice…
my only sound…
brings time of childish fears…
back around…
your actions bind me here…
they do it even now 
after all these years…
I am still…
I see you there
I can not move
I can not care for you…
I can not care for me…
I can not look at you
I can not look at me
I can not look away
they are there
they come and go…
I close my eyes
and fly away…
to a world
where we can stay
on an island…
so far away…..
