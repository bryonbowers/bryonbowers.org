[Chorus]
I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they’re floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender 
One more round…

I disappear from the world
when it gets too much
People drain me of my powers
they like to talk and such
I like a good book
Solitude is my solace
Like to dive deep down
In the ancient past
I could just lay down 
In the water and drown
Sumerian Clay tablet 
Laying on the ground
One of many
Never found…

[Chorus]
I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they’re floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender 
One more round…

Mystery coalition 
Of Sea people attack
Egypt fights back 
On those nile shores
King rises up
In 20 years he is gone…
Bronze Age Collapse
The weather’s gone bad…
Assyrian Empire
Knowledge lost
Buildings crumbling in the wind
two factions battled it out
But Nobody won in the end…
Somebody’s gonna rise up again…
Civilization lost
People fighting over power, food, and water
Make that cost minuscule
Then the people 
They can rule…

[Chorus]
I got caught in the rain
On a hot July day
Bare Feet Burning
Now they’re floating away…
Deadpool cupcakes
Peach cider in my chalice
I took more showers
than Debbie does Dallas
Come on bar tender 
One more round…
