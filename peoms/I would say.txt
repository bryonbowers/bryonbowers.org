[Chorus]
Life is a series
of long goodbyes
Mine to you too short
as boy a man sits down and cries
As his love
Lays down and dies…
Wish I could go back…
Back to that day…
And tell you…
How much you meant to me
They said you knew
But I don't think you did
How about you come back for a day?
I have so much
I'd like to say…

Like what was your first memory?
And what did you think of me?
Why was he so mad?
and how did you watch over so many?
Did you ever pick your nose?
Who was your first kiss?
Up in heaven, what of earth do you most miss?

[Chorus]
Life is a series
of long goodbyes
Mine to you too short
as boy a man sits down and cries
As his love
Lays down and dies…
Wish I could go back…
Back to that day…
And tell you…
How much you meant to me
They said you knew
But I don't think you did
How about you come back for a day?
I have so much
I'd like to say…


What are you thinking?
Are you scared?
Do you want some water?
Are you hungry?
Is your head comfortable?
Do you know how much we all love you?
Do you know how big you are to me?
Do you know how much I need you in this world?
Do you know your odds?
Does my optimism mask your fear?
Do you know when I am bad
It is your voice I hear…

[Chorus]
Life is a series
of long goodbyes
Mine to you too short
as boy a man sits down and cries
As his love
Lays down and dies…
Wish I could go back…
Back to that day…
And tell you…
How much you meant to me
They said you knew
But I don't think you did
How about you come back for a day?
I have so much
I'd like to say I love you so much
thank you for saving me…
thank you for your mind in this world....
thank you for your love...
