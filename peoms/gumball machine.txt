Gumballs and Blood…
On the Barn Room Floor…
Red Canned tomatoes…
Lining every wall…
Saw you climbing
Then I Heard you Fall…
My Heart was pumping
Your Eyes wide open…
Ran So Hard…
Bloody Feet never touched the floor…

[Chorus]
Blood on the Floor
Attacked by a hinge
On the barn room door
Jumping over fences
Leaping over ditches
That gumball’s gonna 
give you stitches

Shiny Gumball machine
Sitting’ at the top of the barn room stairs
Pennies in our pockets
Sneaking like ninjas
Get those gum balls
Put em in our mouth
Chew ‘em for a minute
Then spit ‘em out…
Then onto the next one
Rinse repeat…

[Chorus]
Blood on the Floor
Attacked by a hinge
On the barn room door
Jumping over fences
Leaping over ditches
That gumball’s gonna 
give you stitches

You were superman
Climbing on the door
That door hinge 
Your kryptonite 
When you fell
You didn’t fall right...
Blood was flowing
From your knee
Adrenaline pumping
Through me
My inner brain
Taking the reins
I started running…
Jumping Barbed Wire Fences…
In single bounds..
Bird in my mouth
I was a Royal..
Hunting hound

[Chorus]
Blood on the Floor
Attacked by a hinge
On the barn room door
Jumping over fences
Leaping over ditches
That gumball’s gonna 
give you stitches

They sewed you up
Gumballs and all
We were Supermen 
Playing with kryptonite Toys…
Two wild and wandering Boys…
Throwing shotgun shells 
Into Fire barrels
Playing with Giant Snapping Turtles
and Copperhead Snakes 
Dancing Barefoot 
In the rain
Damn, did we feel alive!
It’s a wonder we survived!

[Chorus]
Blood on the Floor
Attacked by a hinge
On the barn room door
Jumping over fences
Leaping over ditches
That gumball’s gonna 
give you stitches
