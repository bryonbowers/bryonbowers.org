met you both 
new place
new day….
One was L
The other K
mixed you up
almost every day
professed my love 
to all of you…
a polite decline
with grace
a soft smile
and a blue dress…
a polite decline
with grace
a slightly different soft smile
and a red dress….
coming from one lovely face…

[Chorus]
two of you
one of me
professed my love
it was not to be
both declined
polite with grace
two soft smiles
and one lovely face…

your dad a butcher
at the grocery store…
your mom an angel
with warm eyes and more…
a secret gift
shop lifted to you
Valentine's day
Which one of you?
I have no clue…
I just knew
One was in love with Two

[Chorus]
two of you
one of me
professed my love
it was not to be
both declined
polite with grace
two soft smiles
and one lovely face…

two kind hearts
and 4 brown eyes
no interest in me
distracted my mind
as I tried to read
times tables 
written so small on my arm
they might as well not be there
sweat on my forehead drips
onto 12s and 9s
plans foiled by body ventilation
and the number two

[Chorus]
two of you
one of me
professed my love
it was not to be
both declined
polite with grace
two soft smiles
and one lovely face…

eventually learned to tell you apart
graduation came…
said our polite good byes
where you are both now
I do not know
but I'm guessing
your lives are filled
with soft smiles
lovely faces
and pretty red and blue 
summer dresses….
and boys good enough for all of you …

[Chorus]
two of you
one of me
professed my love
it was not to be
both declined
polite with grace
two soft smiles
and one lovely face…
