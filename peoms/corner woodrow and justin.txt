[chorus]
There’s an old man
always standing
At the corner 
I can see him there
with his curly black hair…
Waving and smiling 
At the passersby…
Does his heart 
match his smile?...
Does he cry hard
once in a while?...
What’s the story
Behind those kind old eyes?...


Did he lose someone
On that very spot?…
Is he looking for
A ghost long gone
Did he lose his love
And his cozy home…
Did someone leave him…
Here.. All alone?...

[chorus]
There’s an old man
always standing
At the corner 
I can see him there
with his curly black hair…
Waving and smiling 
At the passersby…
Does his heart 
match his smile?...
Does he cry hard
once in a while?...
What’s the story
Behind those kind old eyes?...

Does he know something
That we do not?...
Is he from an alternate Universe?
Is he Waiting for me to 
write my next verse?...
Is this the spot…
of the second coming…
Does Jesus enjoy throat singing?...
Does he hum to his favorite tune
while he’s walking his dog?
Is there an alien ship…
Landing lasers pointed here…
At the corner of woodrow and justin
Every day of the year…

[chorus]
There’s an old man
always standing
At the corner 
I can see him there
with his curly black hair…
Waving and smiling 
At the passersby…
Does his heart 
match his smile?...
Does he cry hard
once in a while?...
What’s the story
Behind those kind old eyes?...

I can see in his eyes
a great disguise…
a history is hiding
Deep down In his mind…
Behind the smile
And the friendly waves
Lives a younger man
In his wilder days
He is standing there
In the wake of his past
What happened here?
Did it happen fast?
He lives now
In the echoes of his mind
On that corner
Yourself you will find….

[chorus]
There’s an old man
always standing
At the corner 
I can see him there
with his curly black hair…
Waving and smiling 
At the passersby…
Does his heart 
match his smile?...
Does he cry hard
once in a while?...
What’s the story
Behind those kind old eyes?...
