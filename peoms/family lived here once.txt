vines creeping into every crevice
white paint cracking
curling chips
like the scales of a reptile
peeling off
a family lived here once
drank tea on the porch
late night fights
and drunken nights
kids long gone to the city
empty nest couple 
letting grass go long
garden in disarray
after she passes
he has Vienna sausages
and bananas for dinner
alone under the dull light of an aging tv
he is gone now
house on the edge of nowhere
farm long sold to a conglomerate
mill shut down
house never sold to another…
now a ward of the state
an unclaimed asset
no longer a home
but a red line on a state budget sheet…
baby racoons play
In the remnants of a sandbox
an old red wagon long turned to rust decays nearby
possums mosey and sleep under the porch
as the rain comes down
weathering the old yellow pine studs more
moisture seeping into dehydrated fiber
a 100 year flood comes and washes it all away
only thing left an old rusty tractor nearby
too heavy for the renewal of time
sentenced to multiple lifetimes
of the people driving by….
young eyes counting trees and telephone poles
fall on treasures rusted remnants of old…
frozen in time
they are sentries of the past
reminding us
that time
it do pass
and all things crumble
to the water and winds of time…
