Baby Blue station wagon on a hot Texas day got my church clothes on confession comin’ my way… Voices risin’ filling up my ears don't see no god Taking' way my fears Been lookin’ hard For all these years… [chorus] Your angel eyes  Locked in on me One evil root  Climbing’ up my tree You take off your Angel crown I’ll put on my Devil’s Suit white robes flowin’ pageantry on a lovely day thinking of ringing your bell in that very special way your knowing angel eyes smiling back at me holy spirit coming out  same mouth it came on in [chorus] Your angel eyes  Locked in on me One evil root  Climbing’ up my tree You take off your Angel crown I’ll put on my Devil’s Suit Tabernacle day Your body sways down the line Hair bobbin’ side to side gotta drink that blood talk about that flood  water’s comin’ comin’ down your finger stopping’ at the tip stopping’ there to linger [chorus] Your angel eyes  Locked in on me One evil root  Climbing’ up my tree You take off your Angel crown I’ll put on my Devil’s Suit
