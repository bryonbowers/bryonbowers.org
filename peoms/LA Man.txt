The LA Man Said to the Federal Soldiers...
“You feel tough
With your assault Rifles and Sticks…
You should be standing here with us!...
You’re on the wrong side of history…
We know you have a job to do…
But you took an Oath to the Constitution…
Not to the Fascists in the White House…
Think about what you’re doing now
Think about what this means…
Coming into our community…”

[chorus]
The LA Man is Standing 
He’s standing by the Barricades
U.S. soldiers With their sticks and guns
Looking back with shame
He knows you got a job to do
But you have a decision to make
You can follow the clown king fascist
Or abide by the Constitution
You can stand with us the people
Or write yourself 
Into the wrong
side of history

Fascists trying to manufacture violence
Hoping fear keeps the people in silence
I got news for you fascist fucks
We’re putting Soap Boxes 
At every Barricade
Abraham Lincoln’s waking up
He’s making love to Rosie the Riveter
Teddy Roosevelt is really pissed
He sees you Raping our National Parks
You just opened up half for logging!
Apathy is out the window
The people are waking up
Now you can call it woke
It’s not a virus if it helps the people
Think of it like a cure to the Assholes rising

[chorus]
The LA Man is Standing 
He’s standing by the Barricades
U.S. soldiers With their sticks and guns
Looking back with shame
He knows you got a job to do
But you have a decision to make
You can follow the clown king fascist
Or abide by the Constitution
You can stand with us the people
Or write yourself 
Into the wrong
side of history
