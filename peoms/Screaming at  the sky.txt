Stepped outside
To scream at the sky
she tried to help you
You shrugged when she died…
A youth of smiles
Now only angry eyes
Basic conventions
You refused 
To comply…

[Chorus]
The world’s gonna eat you up
If you don't listen to it a little…
Put down your armor
and your angry eyes
So I can stop screaming’
At the quiet night skies

Bozo the clown…
at the circus in town
Face all happy
With his Eyes in a frown
You smiled with elation
aa he signed your clown book
Booming voices
Mixed with Red coat Tails
Floors all sticky
Cotton Candy Trails…

[Chorus]
The world’s gonna eat you up
If you don't listen to it a little…
Put down your armor
and your angry eyes
So I can stop screaming’
At the quiet night skies

She tried her best
To mold you for the world
She’s even angry with you
In my memory
They poked and probed
At your changing mind
Just to see what they could find
You were a swinging pendulum
Flattened to a stationary rock
By the doctor’s medicine

[Chorus]
The world’s gonna eat you up
If you don't listen to it a little…
Put down your armor
and your angry eyes
So I can stop screaming’
At the quiet night skies

She’s gone now
But we’re still here
I tried, I really did
But I failed 
Had to come up for air
You had to swim on your own
Rips my heart apart
I couldn't help you
Maybe some day
We’ll meet up again
At some point 
on the ocean's surface
Where there are no rip tides
pulling us down…

[Chorus]
The world’s gonna eat you up
If you don't listen to it a little…
Put down your armor
and your angry eyes
So I can stop screaming’
At the quiet night skies
