the last italian glass
hit the floor
as tiny thieves steal
my winnings…
guns drawn
mutually destroyed
Ice melted puddles 
childish laughter
dripped onto a wooden floor…
they all chased the queen
looking for that royal flush…
at the end of the rainbow
when they found it
they were awestruck
eyes wide mouths gawking…
all the gold dumped into the leprechauns coffers
not from need
but pure relentless greed…
his mind had to feed 
the rich get richer
the poor poorer
middle squeezed between…
cries of help unseen…
the orange troll’s
opulence obscene
as he attempts to dawn the kind mask of Mamdani 
his cruel features too strong to obscure
his con man mask melting off for all to see
the world buckles under his enormous idiocy
What can we do?
I do ask you?
What can we do?
Pick up a broom
Sweep up the glass
all the broken pieces
even the tiny In the 
cracks in between
a nation divided
without civil discourse
knows not what to do
It is a headless corpse
stumbling about
lashing out with the tariffs of a mad man
no real captain at the helm
just a fox news hallucination 
a weak man’s attempt 
at power
a sad attempt at the wizard of oz
this wizard has no contraptions
no curtain
just 2 hands
doing who knows what
blowing bubba who knows where…
while the ghost of jeffrey epstein
hovers about him whispering secrets of their past
to everyone on the megaphone of his death
empathy is under attack
and the people know it too
So goodbye hatefulness
goodbye vengeance
goodbye quiet little piggy...
