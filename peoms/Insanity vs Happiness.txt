We stumble about
Teetering On the Thin Line 
Between Insanity
and Happiness
Propped up by
Self Delusion
A self
Once wild
And Exploring 
Now Mild
And reliably Boring…
Tamed by Adulting
Slowly Widdled
One hour commutes
Forced Ties on Business Suits
Joker on the Screen
Dancing down the stairs
Sadness Strikes a Chord
We're buying his wares

[Chorus]
Dancing down the Stairs
Joker’s striking a chord
People
