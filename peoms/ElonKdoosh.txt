Hello, and welcome to the Elon Is a Kadoosh Podcast.
This podcast will be chronicling the timeline of Trump’s Rise to power much like ancient roman historians chronicled Rome’s fall from a democracy to an Empire.
To do this, I am going to research all the steps that Julius Caesar and his more successful successors took in order to cease power and destroy their Democracy.
But I will be doing this in the form of AI generated Musical Theatre.
