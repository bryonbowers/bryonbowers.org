Nice and Hot.. All her troubles… Are forgot… Now she’s taking’ one last bath Before the Devil… serves his wrath She Sold her soul for a “Yes MehM”... and a “Please” Kids crawling on the roof and running by the pool acting’ up in school acting’ a fool She said “where do I sign?” “On the front or behind?” He said, honey here’s a toke… N of appreciation For the parent occupation smoke it up now get your mind wow ‘cause the fires of hell are gonna ring your bell [chorus] kids climbing on the walls Getting’ concerned teacher calls… Pour the water.. Nice and Hot.. All her troubles… Are forgot… Now she’s taking’ one last bath Before the Devil… serves his wrath She Sold her soul for a “Yes MehM”... and a “Please” All of a sudden As she pleaded on her knees Kid’s started listening Saying “Yes MehM” and “Please” Picking’ up their dishes Covering’ their mouth  when they sneeze She done sold her soul For a “Yes MehM” and a “Please” tuck in the kids kiss ‘em good night don’t forget to hold them tight cause this might be your last good night [chorus] kids climbing on the walls Getting’ concerned teacher calls… Pour the water..
