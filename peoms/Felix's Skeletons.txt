[chorus] Lights are on But nobody’s home they were all gone  a long time ago Time is an evil sweet mistress Bringing you love and death she’s stealing’ a piece of you With every breath Like hot sauce on a summer day Or ice cream on a cold winter night Sometimes your mind’s at bay Sometimes it never feels quite right [chorus] Lights are on But nobody’s home they were all gone  a long time ago Time is an evil sweet mistress Bringing you love and death she’s stealing’ a piece of you With every breath Cold wind on an April morning Birds singing’ wake up babies World’s outside It's Waiting for you The Universe doesn't  Know what to do If it doesn't Include me with you [chorus] Lights are on But nobody’s home they were all gone  a long time ago Time is an evil sweet mistress Bringing you love and death she’s stealing’ a piece of you With every breath I've been working’ everyday Waiting for that free time to come to me Pretty sure everybody's running as fast Feel like I should be Having’ a blast But the old man In the back of my brain Is making some days Look like rain [chorus] Lights are on But nobody’s home they were all gone  a long time ago Time is an evil sweet mistress Bringing you love and death she’s stealing’ a piece of you With every breath Pitter Patter of feet On the east texas street Skeleton demons pushing baby buggies Winking as they go by Pink Floyd playing on the radio Beer in his hand before he goes [chorus] Lights are on But nobody’s home they were all gone  a long time ago Time is an evil sweet mistress Bringing you love and death she’s stealing’ a piece of you With every breath
