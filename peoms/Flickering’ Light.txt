Flickering’ Light By the pool bathroom doors Everyone else asleep  My eyes locked on yours You were climbing in my head your forest wild and pulsing Your hand an eager forest guide Our chemistry immediate Pretend to the bathroom Over the fence Into the pool I was a bull  without a brain You an insane tiger  high on cocaine [Chorus] Wild animals Swimming’… on a Cool Saturday Night.. Cricket Symphony… Riding stars on pale moonlight.. Bull with no brain… Tiger cocaine… Slowly floating’ Til’ Sunday Morning Sometimes love comes… Warm no warning… Gave you a ride home next morning  In front of everyone You were a church princess Alone with me  A love Sorceress  Wild unyielding  Biting and scratching Primal and climbing [Chorus] Wild animals Swimming’… on a Cool Saturday Night.. Cricket Symphony… Riding stars on pale moonlight.. Bull with no brain… Tiger cocaine… Slowly floating’ Til’ Sunday Morning Sometimes love comes… Warm no warning… Cucumber lotion in the park Club house movie that we never watched Grama sent little brothers As crazy love buffers Got to your house My little brother had to pee Found out your mom was as racist as could be You said you weren't But I said family dinners might be a little awkward [Chorus] Wild animals Swimming’… on a Cool Saturday Night.. Cricket Symphony… Riding stars on pale moonlight.. Bull with no brain… Tiger cocaine… Slowly floating’ Til’ Sunday Morning Sometimes love comes… Warm no warning… We collided one more time Against my better judgement  We talked more that night Than any other I dropped you off  our last kiss goodbye I said take care as you began to cry As you walked in your racist mom waved goodbye wish I'd flipped her off  as I drove away… [Chorus] Wild animals Swimming’… on a Cool Saturday Night.. Cricket Symphony… Riding stars on pale moonlight.. Bull with no brain… Tiger cocaine… Slowly floating’ Til’ Sunday Morning Sometimes love comes… Warm no warning…
