poured my heart out today
I can't meet your eyes
my shame laid out
you know me now
I was a stupid boy
I found the cracks
I was looking for
I wiggled in
laid down inside
you questioned why?
said I wanted something that I did not have
a unit of my own
I see that now
with opened eyes

[chorus]
there are cracks in the porcelain
pieces all over
A stupid boy just broke it
He wiggled in between
Crawled inside unseen
Thrown away
Picked back up
Just a child
Hungry, thirsty, and wild…

I was thrown away
picked back up again
looked for you behind every bath 
looked for you in every bed
first time out my mouth was said
I told you with a heavy dread
judge me now
please judge me not
I know not what I do
I'm just a boy…
crying out for you…
where did you go
so long ago…
where I'm bound…
I do now know
anywhere not with you…
always in my head
I carry you
I wanna put you down 
let me free
stop torturing of me

[chorus]
there are cracks in the porcelain
pieces all over
A stupid boy just broke it
He wiggled in between
Crawled inside unseen
Thrown away
Picked back up
Just a child
Hungry, thirsty, and wild…



I looked for you in many eyes
in the cracks of porcelain
Of perfect homes
are the hungry, thirsty, and wild
vibrating underneath
saw it easy
argument silent behind car glass
his impatient shuffle out of mass
her exasperated glances of anger and loathing
glances at lips
flip of the hair
a slight little stare
gave access to happiness 
and a little crazy
a temporary filling of a heart that wasn't you
you broke me
I broke them
broken pieces…
we are all pieces lost in time….


[chorus]
there are cracks in the porcelain
pieces all over
A stupid boy just broke it
He wiggled in between
Crawled inside unseen
Thrown away
Picked back up
Just a child
Hungry, thirsty, and wild…
