I Danced with you
By the old oak tree
Razor in your hand
You were trying to cut me
Once on the wrist 
We did the twist
I ran so fast
Little red drops
On the nurse tile floor

[Chorus]
There’s a Dancing Kid
By the old oak tree
Razor in his hand
He’s trying to kill me
Ran so fast
I forgot me
Way back there
At the old oak tree

How did I get there?
I don't recall
Either he was crazy
Or I was rude
Wonder what happened 
To that crazy dude

[Chorus]
There’s a Dancing Kid
By the old oak tree
Razor in his hand
He’s trying to kill me
Ran so fast
I forgot me
Way back there
At the old oak tree

My first friend
His name was Oscar
His clothes were tattered
Just like mine
We hung out at recess
We talked of life
Built a teepee
He took a wife
They Lived a long feathered life

[Chorus]
There’s a Dancing Kid
By the old oak tree
Razor in his hand
He’s trying to kill me
Ran so fast
I forgot me
Way back there
At the old oak tree

Then one day
Came the crazy kid
He took out his dad’s razor
He cut me on the wrist
We circled the tree
Mad max style
Then Instinct kicked in
It was him or me
By the old oak tree

[Chorus]
There’s a Dancing Kid
By the old oak tree
Razor in his hand
He’s trying to kill me
Ran so fast
I forgot me
Way back there
At the old oak tree
