Watching’ Lawrence Welk Sunday Night repeat Steam crawling’ out my Tomato soup Sitting’ on the edge of my seat Handsome men In three piece suits dancing’ with Pretty women wearing’ frilly Summer dresses [Chorus] Thrown in the Ocean A young child screams Strange creature of water Only swims in her dreams Lay down your head Rest your weary bones I'll carry you with me Wherever I go New England clam chowder sitting’ on her TV tray saltine crackers and old hats stacked high Long out of fashion But precious still For Sunday Mass or a trip to the beach Little Barb and Teddy always packed and ready fighting’ all the way home [Chorus] Thrown in the Ocean A young child screams Strange creature of water Only swims in her dreams Lay down your head Rest your weary bones I'll carry you with me Wherever I go You made me read TV Kid In my room ‘til I did Trapeze on the bed post edge  Watching the Carol Burnett show Reflected off the mirror Through the crack  of my bedroom door slapstick funny And faces a skew Never knew  What that crazy lady would do [Chorus] Thrown in the Ocean A young child screams Strange creature of water Only swims in her dreams Lay down your head Rest your weary bones I'll carry you with me Wherever I go One hour foot rub Tales from the Crypt exchange while you read Stephen King As the crypt keeper creeps One bad pun There goes another Dreamed I was falling You're probably reading right now In some other dimension [Chorus] Thrown in the Ocean A young child screams Strange creature of water Only swims in her dreams Lay down your head Rest your weary bones I'll carry you with me Wherever I go [Fade Out]
