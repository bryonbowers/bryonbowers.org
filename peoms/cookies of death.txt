saw a god like figure
standing on a hill
flying over life
I was standing still
same dream every night
but a different day
world burning 
A fake orange smile 
with a greasy sway…
cookies of death
Smiling innocent down the stairs…
a cruel world
waiting outside an oasis
made of apathy 
and anonymity too…
eventually they’ll come
for her freedoms too…

[chorus]
injustice for one
is injustice for all
phone still ringing
Gonna take that call?
cookies of death
walking down the stairs
tyrant is ranting
selling his wares..
frogs on a slow boil
nobody cares…

the soldiers marchingIn our own streets 
nation forced to a slow decay
eroding a little more every day
tyrant speeches
to honorable men
staring back…audacity in their eyes
faces like stone
not a clap heard
as the clown king
and his most incompetent minion
flap about in fear and idiocy
on an undeserving stage and time


[chorus]
injustice for one
is injustice for all
phone still ringing
Gonna take that call?
cookies of death
walking down the stairs
tyrant is ranting
selling his wares..
frogs on a slow boil
nobody cares…

watching the world hold
against a wave of hate and silence
people stand and watch a tyrant
laugh as they do
eventually they will come for you
working hard at your task
hours go by
you are part of a red ant collective
crawling safely
as the rock slide destroys
bigger animals around you
lacking shelter of citizenship or anonymity
we fuel the machinery of hate
we allow it to fester and do its deed


[chorus]
injustice for one
is injustice for all
phone still ringing
Gonna take that call?
cookies of death
walking down the stairs
tyrant is ranting
selling his wares..
frogs on a slow boil
nobody cares…
