our bodies entangled… 
pressed hard…
black camaro warm against my back
eyes and lips locked
gas fumes and you 
breathing into me…
electric hands roaming into…
white washed jeans
my eyes dart
looking for church elder eyes…
I rush to get gas in the car
before my reputation is blown

[chorus]
Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupidA feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…

your wildness sliding down.. 
claws digging into me 
Pleasant pain in my neck
overcome by your ferocity…
There's a thin line
Between you and me
Is it attraction or insanity

[chorus]
Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupidA feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…

my mind was stupid
and slowed around you
down to a dull drum
your body on me…
my pulse on your thumb…
pounded in my head
you a feral cat
me your scratching post

[chorus]
Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupidA feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…

Had to gather my thoughts
Get you back in the car
Put it in gear
We wouldn't drive far
The night was young
and we were free
Your body was tight
Wrapped around me…

[chorus]
Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupidA feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…

[chorus]
Shot by cupid
Mind gone stupidA feral cat
in my white wash jeans…
blowing my cover
crawling all over me…
