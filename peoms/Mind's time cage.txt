[Chorus]
Four O Six
On a Saturday…
Sun is Shining
And I wanna play…
I waited for you
You never came…
Now the sun doesn't shine
Quite the same…

Infinite Blue
On a Dull Brick Wall
Green dress on
Mustache and all
She’s sitcom cute
Short Cut Hair
Tight T-shirt on
In her underwear

[Chorus]
Four O Six
On a Saturday…
Sun is Shining
And I wanna play…
I waited for you
You never came…
Now the sun doesn't shine
Quite the same…

One more time…
That's what you said…
See you there…
Next Saturday…
But you did not come…
You went away…
Music plays in the background now…
My body can feel you on every sound
Just me laying on that warm cold ground…

[Chorus]
Four O Six
On a Saturday…
Sun is Shining
And I wanna play…
I waited for you
You never came…
Now the sun doesn't shine
Quite the same…

A future never realized
me looking for your eyes
I was too busy chasing
Looking for my prize…
Didn't stop to think
You Left me on that stage
Now my mind has you Stuck
In its own time cage…
knocking on my door
with that silent old rage
You're looking for more…
But I’ve sold the store…

[Chorus]
Four O Six
On a Saturday…
Sun is Shining
And I wanna play…
I waited for you
You never came…
Now the sun doesn't shine
Quite the same…
