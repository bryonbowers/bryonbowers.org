you came prancing bobbing
through the door
I could smell your scent
before we hit the floor…
you were different
than before…
lighter now…
your finger said
you’ve been rolling round
in another bed…
this I knew
need not said…
stupid jealousy in my head…

[Chorus]
you’ve been rolling…
rolling on that ground…
your body’s been rolling…
rolling round town…
2 weddings crashed
2 different nights
secret agents 
morning delights…

hotel busy
suits stuffed all around
fake name tags on
wedding crashers dine
one is young
other fine wine …
cute couple
they are told…
darkness falls
soft light on drinks
smoke rising
table cloth my drapes
napkin dropped…
darkness going down…
nobody knows us…
we’re from outta town…
drink their bodies 
back to the room
sadness in his heart
he closes his eyes
and falls asleep …

[Chorus]
you’ve been rolling…
rolling on that ground…
your body’s been rolling…
rolling round town…
2 weddings crashed
2 different nights
secret agents 
morning delights…


rolling  ‘around…
they are rolling ‘around…
bodies breathing
soft and sound…
slow and measured…
slow in time….
one last morning….
one last time…
one last kiss…
my love your crime…

[Chorus]
you’ve been rolling…
rolling on that ground…
your body’s been rolling…
rolling round town…
2 weddings crashed
2 different nights
secret agents 
morning delights…
