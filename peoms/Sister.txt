You left first
On the ring of a bell
Soft music playing
That new glue smell
I’m Laying on a Towel…
Just drank my milk
Dreams of dragons
and wizard’s Silk…
Dreading sleep
And wanting’ it too
When I woke up…
I lost you…

[Chorus]
Sister, where did you go?...
Can’t find you in the house…
You’re not in the Cedar Chest…
Or in the Forest out back…
Come on out…
The game is over…
I promise you can paint my nails
Or give me ponytails…

I got home
Found out you were gone
Thought I’d never see you again
Heard you went to Ohio
Then I heard you moved back again
A mom and dad of your own
Living in 2 homes

[Chorus]
Sister, where did you go?...
Can’t find you in the house…
You’re not in the Cedar Chest…
Or in the Forest out back…
Come on out…
The game is over…
I promise you can paint my nails
Or give me ponytails…

I still have the 
2 tiny blue robots
That you gave me
When I came to your new home…
They’re sitting’ in 
my treasure box
Keeping company with 
Old shark teeth
And Letters 
from the past

[Chorus]
Sister, where did you go?...
Can’t find you in the house…
You’re not in the Cedar Chest…
Or in the Forest out back…
Come on out…
The game is over…
I promise you can paint my nails
Or give me ponytails…
