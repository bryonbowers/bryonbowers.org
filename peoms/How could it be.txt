How could it be?
Oh Me, Oh My….
How could half a Country
Vote for a Felon, A Scoundrel, 
A down right rotten Melon?

How could they….
Vote for a man who said when you’re rich,
You can grab em by the Pussy
And move on them like a Bitch.

He’s Sloven, He’s Awkward, He lacks charisma,
He’s spreading his malice 
Like a foul miasma.

He thinks our Brave Soldiers
Are Losers and Suckers
I think Trump is a 
Bone Spur Dumbass Mother Fucker

Well….the Asshole’s in the whitehouse
And he’s shitting on the Capital steps

Singing Retribution, Divide our Nation
Liberty needs a new occupation

Lady Liberty’s being stabbed..
While her Pussy’s being grabbed
By the Asshole from Mar-a-Lago

He’s kneeling on her neck
She’s barely breathing…
Gotta help her out
Guys….stop kneeling

Stand Up Guys,
Wipe that Trump out of your eyes
Go help that Democracy you despise

Democracy is under Attack
Oh The Fascists…..
They’ve come Back

Lady Liberty screams in pain
Democracy cries in Vain

What do I tell my children
When I brag about my nation?

Do I tell them of the Anger
Dividing our creation?
Or the president who doesn’t 
Give a shit about our Nation

Do I tell them that Hate Trumps Love?
Do I tell them the Villain won?
Do I tell them sometimes bad guys win?
And sometimes….they win Again?

Will our children be ashamed of us?
Will History be sad for us?

Will the people that we hurt today
Forgive us our shitty Way?
