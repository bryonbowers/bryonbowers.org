Change is hard
Fascism is harder
Keep your fucking hands 
Off our Democracy
Freedom even misspelled 
Still holds true
50 million dollars wasted
16 million just to fix
70 ton Tank Cracks
In a nation divided
Soldiers forced to prance 
For Clown Jong Eww

[Chorus]
My grampa fought Hitler
Now our soldiers
March for 
Clown Jong Ewww… 
Change is hard
Fascism is Harder
Greatest Con Man 
Of all time
Not a day in jail
For all his crime

Hollow parade for a bully 
and a coward
Called our soldiers
Losers and Suckers
While pardoning 
Those fascist
Criminal fuckers
Attacked capital police
Shit in our Capital Halls
Disgraced our nation
Now doing it again
Arresting citizens
For peacefully protesting


[Chorus]
My grampa fought Hitler
Now our soldiers
March for 
Clown Jong Ewww… 
Change is hard
Fascism is Harder
Greatest Con Man 
Of all time
Not a day in jail
For all his crime

Invading cities of kindness
Violating our constitution at every turn
Manufacturing violence in the name of liberation
Senator Palpatine Nasty Fucker
Fat and plump a Putin Simp
Disappearing hard workers
Pillars of the community 
All because weasel Stephen Miller
Cracks the whip 
Says go to the home depots
So much anger 
And hate in one man
Bet he runs with the Ku Klux Klan

[Chorus]
My grampa fought Hitler
Now our soldiers
March for 
Clown Jong Ewww… 
Change is hard
Fascism is Harder
Greatest Con Man 
Of all time
Not a day in jail
For all his crime
