i wake each morning
the world in light anew
I am a man of many treasures
my loves gathered around
word pebbles at their feet
gathered through the years…
In my mind
and in this world
I travel through it
visiting palaces built in my dreams
ghosts of my past
walking through the halls
ringing the bells at midnight
they tip toe all around
making almost no sound…

[chorus]
Fragile Figurines
On your Christmas Tree…
Watching’ Godzilla 
And Bruce Lee…
Cold Outside
Inside a warm bath with you…
Now you’re just Silent Tip Toes..
In a Palace Made of dreams

Winter nipping
a nose or two
Heavy coats
And warm spiced tea
Books by the fire
underneath the great desire
people say
And people do
bruce lee’s silence tensing
godzilla’s mighty roar
you looked at me 
I looked at you
a door locked
frozen in time
nailed shut
love your crime..

[chorus]
Fragile Figurines
On your Christmas Tree…
Watching’ Godzilla 
And Bruce Lee…
Cold Outside
Inside a warm bath with you…
Now you’re just Silent Tip Toes..
In a Palace Made of dreams

Frollicking in palaces 
built of wood and trees
and fragile frog figurines
wallpaper everywhere…
nature scenes…
repeated pattern angering my brain
a full mural needed
Incompleteness evident in its repetition
two people now melted together
as the water flows
hot steam fogging the mirror
Imperfections exposed on its surface
messages written long ago
now revealed…


[chorus]
Fragile Figurines
On your Christmas Tree…
Watching’ Godzilla 
And Bruce Lee…
Cold Outside
Inside a warm bath with you…
Now you’re just Silent Tip Toes..
In a Palace Made of dreams

Before you…
my dreams were as vivid as the waking world
Now my dreams are foggy
And lost at waking…
As if my mind
Is hiding the dream world from me
a dream world where I once wondered free
I Flew 
I Built
I Calculated
I Travelled in Space and Time…
Once a squirrel said hello to me…
Now he is silent
And spends his days burying nuts 
by the old pine tree…

[chorus]
Fragile Figurines
On your Christmas Tree…
Watching’ Godzilla 
And Bruce Lee…
Cold Outside
Inside a warm bath with you…
Now you’re just Silent Tip Toes..
In a Palace Made of dreams
