Lord Byron lounges by the pool
With that Original bad boy stare…
Drinking wine from a human skull
Throwing fish to his Pet Bear
His friends spitting out
Staples of Modern Horror…
Culture on a Weekend Dare…
One his Doctor Father of Vampires
The other Mary
Mother of Frankenstein
A fly on that wall
ohhhhhh what it saw…
minds on fire
Passionate exchanges
of thoughts and liquids
Talks of Revolution
and Liberty of man

[Chorus]
He was a man of many vices
He loved men, women, and revolution
He gave us Vampires, Frankenstein, 
And Babbage’s Love Lace Fairy
Beauty in his words
Travel across centuries  


His daughter Ada Lovelace
Mother of Algorithms
Thrown by her mother
Into mathematical Rigor
To stamp out Byronic Imagination
Babbage called her “The Enchantress of Numbers”
She call herself his “Fairy”
Drug induced confessions
Blew her husband's mind…
What did she say?
To give Mr. Lovelace
Such a sour face…
Consumption took her at 36
Laid down with her dad
In the dirty mix

[Chorus]
He was a man of many vices
He loved men, women, and revolution
He gave us Vampires, Frankenstein, 
And Babbage’s Love Lace Fairy
Beauty in his words
Travel across centuries  

A poor boy with a club foot
Transformed to a Baron
A Purveyor of Revolution 
Lost not to sword or cannon
But to leeches and a fever
Survived by his dog’s epitaph
"all the virtues of Man without his vices.”

[Chorus]
He was a man of many vices
He loved men, women, and revolution
He gave us Vampires, Frankenstein, 
And Babbage’s Love Lace Fairy
Beauty in his words
Travel across centuries
