There's a certain peacocking A bravado if you will To the art  Of bending someone to your will With words you can crush a man with well placed words you can destroy a man's heart and therein lies the art I spit words in time thought is my crime Lovers in the night wake up head tight waiting til the moment’s right I'm dropping word bombs On your village tonight Pushing my agenda Like a crazy rabid ninja Jump up and get down Turn your ass around You gotta get up to get down can you hear my sound Today I had meetings out the wazoo I wanted to fly away like superman but I gotta keep money in the pan feed the babies make sure they don't get rabies working for the man giving away my life I'm bacon cooking in a pan wrapped up in strife pennies in my pocket my life's a rocket heading up straight to space watching the world in disgrace why’d you guys do it you let him ruin it tokin away rights Like dominos  They fall but not for all  the billionaires are like cockroaches They’ll survive it all
