see boy run…
see boy jump..
one lily pad 
to another slump…
Looking for you
In a little crazy
can’t help himself
he’s a troubadour
bodies poised 
just like yours
See you in the moment 
on the edge of insanity
and Shaking…
Breathing…
eyes locked on me
well the eyes do invite
It is only polite
to join them in
the delight of the night…
joy real but fleeting
lacking pine needle stings
on the back
wind on your skin

[chorus]
pine needle sting
wind on the skin
sun poking through
you’re shaking again
breathe some
and kissing too
I’m getting tired
of looking for you…

they lurk about
looking for love
praising that lord
above….
Steamed and laid out nice
I was clothing to you 
you wore me once and hung me out 
your White picket fence
and your office too
That’s ok
I wore you too
Wasn’t looking for you…

[chorus]
pine needle sting
wind on the skin
sun poking through
you’re shaking again
breathe some
and kissing too
I’m getting tired
of looking for you…


Stumbled down
To the grocery store
Wearing glasses
Moose in my hair
Holes in my jeans
I was trying to be a corey
“Dream a little Dream”
“Lost Boys” didn’t care..
Caught your eye in the frozen section
You used me
I used you too
That’s ok…
I wasn’t looking for you…
You had some good manners
And so did I…
Did your dishes before I left

[chorus]
pine needle sting
wind on the skin
sun poking through
you’re shaking again
breathe some
and kissing too
I’m getting tired
of looking for you…

Saw you in church
You were with him
Eating some bread…
Drinking some wine…
Saw you at home
You were with me
Shaking with me
Drinking my blood
Left you there
In your Perfect home
With your Perfect man
And your perfect life…
Back at church don’t know me
But that’s ok…
I wasn’t looking for you…

[chorus]
pine needle sting
wind on the skin
sun poking through
you’re shaking again
breathe some
and kissing too
I’m getting tired
of looking for you…
