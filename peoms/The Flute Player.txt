She sat on the first row
I was on the last

Summer Trip to DC
We all had a blast

Peelin off your Band Suit
On a Friday Night Bus Ride

Kissin in the darkness
Fighting with your Daisy Dukes

[Chorus]
Summer’s Comin round the Bend
What a lovely ride it’s been
I found your heart in 7th grade
and Lost it on a Saturday
Where are you?
Who am I?
Will I ever find me
Well I guess I can try…

Senior Year, a Rainy Day
We snuck outside to flirt and play

Dancin in the Rain with you
Your Red cheeks started turning blue

We locked eyes, but we didn’t kiss
I was hers, and you were his

[Chorus]
Summer’s Comin round the Bend
What a lovely ride it’s been
I found your heart in 7th grade
and Lost it on a Saturday
Where are you?
Who am I?
Will I ever find me
Well I guess I can try…

College Comes
and People Go
all the things 
I used to know
have vanished into memories
a forest with a million trees

[Chorus]
Summer’s Comin round the Bend
What a lovely ride it’s been
I found your heart in 7th grade
and Lost it on a Saturday
Where are you?
Who am I?
Will I ever find me
Well I guess I can try…
