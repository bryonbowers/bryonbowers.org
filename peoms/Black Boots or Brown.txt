She walked into the room
with that sultry little grin
She's gonna ask me 
a gotcha question again

[Chorus]
She said Black Boots or Brown
I said I don't really care
as long as its the only...
thing your’ gonna wear

She said honey 
Answer the question
I don’t have a lot of time
I got things to do
Gotta earn that dime

I said Baby take a minute, 
Life is way too fast…
When your’ only spending money
chasing that cash…

[Chorus]
She said Black Boots or Brown
I said I don't really care
as long as its the only...
thing your’ gonna wear

She said money don’t grow on trees
I’m down here on my knees
I just need a simple answer
Won’t you answer me please

[Chorus]
She said Black Boots or Brown
I said I don't really care
as long as its the only...
thing your’ gonna wear

She said I don’t have time for this
And walked right out on me
Now she’s Strutin’ round town
Which boots did she choose?
I don't really care
as long as its the only...
thing she’s gonna wear
