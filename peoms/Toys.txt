Optimus Prime
Standing Precariously 
Upon the shelf
Dead eyes staring
Right at me…
With super star power
Jet pack dangling
Off his back
Midriff barely connected
gun by his side
Battle axe at the ready
He can hardly hold himself steady

[Chorus]
It was a Toy Blood Bath
Only the toughest did survive
A boy grows up
Ambitions they arrive
A snapshot of his mind
Innocence left behind
Time marches on…
Calls you on the phone
Says “leave my toys alone…”

A boy cleans his room…
Mom forcing toys to their doom
Now a toy vagabond 
Damned into servitude
Salvation Army Shelves
Squooshy minion body severed 
laying on the wooden floor
funko-pops safe in their boxes
stare down at the purge

[Chorus]
It was a Toy Blood Bath
Only the toughest did survive
A boy grows up
Ambitions they arrive
A snapshot of his mind
Innocence left behind
Time marches on…
Calls you on the phone
Says “leave my toys alone…”

As the trash bag of forgotten toys
Makes its way to the landfill
A boy's heart remembers
long ago epic battles
and shifting alliances 
Blood spilt over 
Invisible Dragon Eggs
Labs with secret mummies 
crawling out of the goo

[Chorus]
It was a Toy Blood Bath
Only the toughest did survive
A boy grows up
Ambitions they arrive
A snapshot of his mind
Innocence left behind
Time marches on…
Calls you on the phone
Says “leave my toys alone…”
