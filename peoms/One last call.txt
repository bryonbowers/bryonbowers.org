A Dark Water Wall
Twenty Six Feet Tall
A Rugged Old Man
Making 2 last calls…
One to his daughter
One to his son


[Choir]
Dark Water Raging…
A Rugged Old Man…
Made one last call…
His wife in his hands…
Son crying on the edge…
Forced to say…
One last goodbye…

His Son stood at the edge…
Muscle and Mind useless…
To the Dark Rage Before Him…
A boy again…
Unable to open the jelly jar…
His mom and dad…
trapped inside…


[Choir]
Dark Water Raging…
A Rugged Old Man…
Made one last call…
His wife in his hands…
Son crying on the edge…
Forced to say…
One last goodbye…

They found the phone down the River
Sealed in a zip lock bag…
Their little dog amazingly survived
The miracle whip they called him…
Over a hundred souls Lost to the Flood
God’s cruel humor on full display…
Still waiting for the punchline today…
I bet it's gonna be Divine…
I bet he’d have wine and caviar…
And drive a Bentley Car…


[Choir]
Dark Water Raging…
A Rugged Old Man…
Made one last call…
His wife in his hands…
Son crying on the edge…
Forced to say…
One last goodbye…
