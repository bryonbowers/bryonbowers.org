I like the smell of gasoline
old car smell is quite serene
a little bit a warm
you a cool mint breeze
over my face
and down my neck
gas station hard
on a hot cool day

[chorus]
tick it do tocks
While I move those golden rocks…
smell of gasoline
on my pillow i do lay
aging bones are grinding
in the light of day….

vagrant pissing by
he’s just living’ his way
gotta make my bread
every damn day…
that screen is yelling
it's yelling at me
I wanna rip it out the wall
throw out the world
then curl up in bed with you

[chorus]
tick it do tocks
While I move those golden rocks…
smell of gasoline
on my pillow i do lay
aging bones are grinding
in the light of day….

I am so tired
tired of this day…
it's about to end….
on my pillow I will lay
my aching bones
getting old in the light of the day…
the world used to be
a little more fun
now tick it do tocks
while I move
giant golden rocks
up the mountain so high
nobody's been to the top …

[chorus]
tick it do tocks
While I move those golden rocks…
smell of gasoline
on my pillow i do lay
aging bones are grinding
in the light of day….
