coldness seeps into my blanket
hairs on my neck slowly rise
ceramic’s orange glow 
a living pulse from the wall
heat evenly spread on my face
It’s colder than most nights
because I’m missing your touch
you’ve gone away
a better place
missing your lips
the taste of you in the dark
caves on the edge of the universe
explored now only by me

[chorus]
a lonely boy 
sits in a cave 
at the edge of the Universe..
soft orange glow 
heat on his face
waiting for his helium ballerina

a raw hunger within my body
needs you
warm waters now cold
cold waters turned tired and old…
the way you put your hands on your hips
the purse of your lips
trickled off overalls mid-day
lesson of the day
kiss me this way
hands explore
my body does implore
of you more

[chorus]
a lonely boy 
sits in a cave 
at the edge of the Universe..
soft orange glow 
heat on his face
waiting for his helium ballerina

you are gone to my world
ceramic orange glow…
melting eyes into face
sleep tip toeing to me
pushing my eye lids down…
I can still feel your fingers 
dancing like helium ballerinas
across the hairs of my arm
a nibble on the ear
wrapped up in you
your hair resting on me…
your control complete
over me…

[chorus]
a lonely boy 
sits in a cave 
at the edge of the Universe..
soft orange glow 
heat on his face
waiting for his helium ballerina

your absence 
a bitter taste in my mouth..
metallic…
like a rusty old tractor
abandoned in a field long ago…
by a highway no longer travelled…
no gas stations near by
I walk alone
In my own mind
I am michael to your star
eyes closing now
dreams of you not far away…
as I drift into sleep…

[chorus]
a lonely boy 
sits in a cave 
at the edge of the Universe..
soft orange glow 
heat on his face
waiting for his helium ballerina
