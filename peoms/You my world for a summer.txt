[Pre-Chorus]
Last Summer 
You were my world
I Couldn’t think of anything
But you and me girl…

You were my first kiss
Every moment we had
We’d sneak away quietly
And then we’d be bad

[Chorus]
Last Summer 
You were my world
I Couldn’t think of anything
But you and me girl…
Kissing under trees
and Scraping our knees
Dreading dinner bells
Those sweet roasted smells
I’ll call you when i get home
Or You call me
Tomorrow, we’ll meet under the old pine tree

Phone cords winding out our rooms
I love you baby…
I love you too…
I love you more…
No I do…
Come on guys, hang up the phone
Its kinda late, and your father’s not home
He might be calling
From the other side

[Chorus]
Last Summer 
You were my world
I Couldn’t think of anything
But you and me girl…
Kissing under trees
and Scraping our knees
Dreading dinner bells
Those sweet roasted smells
I’ll call you when i get home
Or You call me
Tomorrow, we’ll meet under the old pine tree

We stole planks of wood from the farmer next door
We built a little house with a rough wood floor
We had a sad bird funeral
Where we both cried
All his dead friends were there
They were mortified
The snake had his winding bones
The turtle had his shell
We wondered if mean animals go to hell
[Chorus]
Last Summer
You were my world
I Couldn’t think of anything
But you and me girl…
Kissing under trees
and Scraping our knees
Dreading dinner bells
Those sweet roasted smells
I’ll call you when i get home
Or You call me
Tomorrow, we’ll meet under the old pine tree

First day of School
I’m walking to the bus stop
I see you standing there by the old Pine Tree
You’re holding someone’s hand, but it’s not me
We lock eyes, not a word
Summer’s gone, and so are we
I hope they never
Cut down the old pine tree

[Chorus]
Last Summer 
You were my world
I Couldn’t think of anything
But you and me girl…
Kissing under trees
and Scraping our knees
Dreading dinner bells
Those sweet roasted smells
I’ll call you when i get home
You call me
Tomorrow, we’ll meet under the old pine tree
