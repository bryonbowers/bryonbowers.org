You were wild You were funny You were Ani Di Franco But s little more sunny You were a freshman One year younger than me You had cute little braces And a pidgin walk I was instantly in love with the way that you talk Your Voice was a little raspy Instantly made me happy Theatre together we kissed But only on script I wrote you letters of i love you from summer camp But you never wrote me back Or maybe I never sent them I couldn't help it at time I went out with other girls,  your hair got more curls  everytime I'd see you Your dad was gray From years of hard work Your mom stern of ald world charm Your brother was my peer We had every class together Wrapped up in my horny adventures I never stopped to give us a chance I don't think your mom likes me anyway
