relax, chill
take a deep breath
slow it on down
have a good ol’ time
let your worries
slide on down
slide on down
echo sound
deep and down
slow your breath
feel your heart beat
relax your body
from your head
to your feet…

[Chorus]
Cold, Hot
Water drippin’ down
Down to the center 
of your restless soul….
Down to the core
Where you don’t wanna go….
Down to the place
with the witch’s face….
Down that hole
she’s got your twisted soul…


obstacles gone
they are far away
there tomorrow 
gone today…
thoughts warm heat
boiling’ your brain
a perfect little place
for the mildly insane
lavender soft
and lemongrass sweet
candles all around
a soft dripping sound…
her voice soft…
soft and sweet…
her control of me…
total and complete….

[Chorus]
Cold, Hot
Water drippin’ down
Down to the center 
of your restless soul….
Down to the core
Where you don’t wanna go….
Down to the place
with the witch’s face….
Down that hole
she’s got your twisted soul…


slide it on down
take a sip
ears under water
blood rushing by
konk shell highway
built in your ears
heat radiating 
melting your fears
up on the ceiling
spider looking’ down
your so relaxed
you don't even care
In and out of sleep
you’re just floating there

[Chorus]
Cold, Hot
Water drippin’ down
Down to the center 
of your restless soul….
Down to the core
Where you don’t wanna go….
Down to the place
with the witch’s face….
Down that hole
she’s got your twisted soul…


Soft and supple
Sweet and Tart
Strings Hanging down
Attached to your heart…
Hands all around
She is too….
Water was Hot
And so were you….
Now you’re cold
And so is she…
Impulse of youth
Some things 
Never meant to be….
Like you….
With me….

[Chorus]
Cold, Hot
Water drippin’ down
Down to the center 
of your restless soul….
Down to the core
Where you don’t wanna go….
Down to the place
with the witch’s face….
Down that hole
she’s got your twisted soul…
