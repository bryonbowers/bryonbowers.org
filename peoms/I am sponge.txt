I am sponge
I soak up Discontent 
Bubbling up around me
I soak up happiness
In a child’s unburdened eyes…
I see a stranger’s sadness 
after a long hard day
A nervous twitch of a furtive eye 
He’s looking to fly from the world tonight…
I see the wall…
That a person sends
With every handshake
The eyes reveal…
I see the absence of something 
inside dead eyes
I see the twinkle of something 
brewing in a thoughtful glance
I see a nervous mother
a defensive stance
as the world walks on by…
Small talk forced by a checkout clerk
Ready to end the day…
A genuine exchange 
With a man dedicated 
on a slightly rainy day
Talks of the past and what could have been
Aloof, an open book
Others an oyster clamped shut
Keeping the world’s poison out…
We humans are fickle creatures
We live inside our own mind cages
Some are made of straw
Others hard brick walls
Placing threats where there are none
Ignoring others just to have some fun
We spend our life
Curating our egos
Float on top of a boat 
Made of judgement 
From Lost loves and Sunday Sermons
There is Universality of being
That we seldom tap into
The common thread of humanity
Flowing through me and you…
Two children crouching….
They shake….
As bombs rattle the rubble
Surrounding them…
Someone is filming
There are Eyes behind the terror unfolding
I see my own children crouched there…
Shivering in the darkness…
Innocent, for the fact
In the wrong place at the wrong time in history
Why can't we all just stop killing each other over mythical creatures and invisible men?
The Universe is more interesting
Than stories of old dead men…
The golden rule ignored
For more cash and Power
Satisfies those filled with Pride and Folly
Entrenched against anyone 
with the audacity to be themselves
In a world where authenticity, integrity, and kindness are fleeting
Being a sponge in this world is exhausting
Love is sprinkled in a vat of hate and anger
seething judgement too
Like someone stuck in a rice silo
Sinking to the bottom 
to a silent wistful death
