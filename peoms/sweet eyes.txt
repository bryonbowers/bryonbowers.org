you had sweet eyes
couldn't look away
just met you
wanted you with me
knew i'd be with you 
for the rest of my life
you were wearing a white sweater
eyes demure and soft
lips pursed as you talked…
you were shy…
but I could see a wild in your walk

[chorus]
eyes soft with a touch of demure
your eyes were sweet
your demeanor couture 
you were a touch of shy
with a little drink of wild
hovering underneath
a soft spoken smile…

you told me of california
and your fashion design
I’ve forgotten my words
my brain was preoccupied
we watched the game
but I really only watched you
my hands usually knowing
didn’t know what to do
our families were watching
I was younger than you
you were college
I was catching up to you

[chorus]
eyes soft with a touch of demure
your eyes were sweet
your demeanor couture 
you were a touch of shy
with a little drink of wild
hovering underneath
a soft spoken smile…

It was time to leave
the puck had stopped sliding…
as we left, i wanted to hug you good bye
an uncool gesture
your family customs unknown
I didn’t want my chances blown
asked my uncle to ask your brother
we connected on the phone…

[chorus]
eyes soft with a touch of demure
your eyes were sweet
your demeanor couture 
you were a touch of shy
with a little drink of wild
hovering underneath
a soft spoken smile…

your grama said don’t date me
on her death bed she did
our minds were connected
pin pals, electric
Internet just rising
keyboard surfers at night
words our exchange
before i held you tight
you gave me your mind
before you gave me your body
a treasure of elegance
a love all mine

[chorus]
eyes soft with a touch of demure
your eyes were sweet
your demeanor couture 
you were a touch of shy
with a little drink of wild
hovering underneath
a soft spoken smile…
