Shacked Up
Your Apartment 
After School
Your Cigarette Breath
Attacking my mouth
Your Legs Flowing
Out your Underwear
You said you liked girls too
I Didn't care

[Chorus]
Your Cigarette Breath…
Attacking me After School…
You gave me Downtown Directions..
To a Lovely Carpet Burn…
We were Strangers…
In a Dark Apartment…
Lingering with you…
One Last Time…

I got lost Downtown
You gave me directions
When I finally found
What you were looking for
You slammed me down hard
On that shag green floor
Next day and Next
I Came back 
For more
We kept it between us
In school we were strangers
I didn't know you
You didn't know me

[Chorus]
Your Cigarette Breath…
Attacking me After School…
You gave me Downtown Directions..
To a Lovely Carpet Burn…
We were Strangers…
In a Dark Apartment…
Lingering with you…
One Last Time…


You called me up…
You said let's talk
I asked ‘about what
You said just come over
You were moving away
One more time for the road
I lingered a bit…
You said enjoy your youth
Your Apartment was darker
When I left that day
I’d miss you…
But not that breath…

[Chorus]
Your Cigarette Breath…
Attacking me After School…
You gave me Downtown Directions..
To a Lovely Carpet Burn…
We were Strangers…
In a Dark Apartment…
Lingering with you…
One Last Time…
