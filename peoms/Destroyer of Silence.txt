Riding in the car
After a long bike ride…
Radio off
Silence circles us
Questions bounce around in my head
I can't keep them in…
So I shattered your
Peaceful silence
Me the Inquisitor 
You Socrates
Looking for his hemlock
In the glove box

[Chorus]
How can one person Be…
So many to me?...
Socrates to my questions
Devil's Advocate to my stances
You were my Uncle Dad Big Brother…
And my Best Friend Too…
I was the Destroyer
Of your Silence
Static to your Radio
Giant Lizard…
To your Chipmunk

To every entrenched
Stance of mine
You were a nonchalant 
Devil's advocate 
Your Patience waning as we drove
You played beauty on the cd player
You gave me Ani, Ellis, Bruce,
and Primitive Radio Gods
I found your old cassettes
Journey, Eagles, and Styx
Hotel California was my lolliby

[Chorus]
How can one person Be…
So many to me?...
Socrates to my questions
Devil's Advocate to my stances
You were my Uncle Dad Big Brother…
And my Best Friend Too…
I was the Destroyer
Of your Silence
Static to your Radio
Giant Lizard…
To your Chipmunk

Every box from the Attic
A sedimentary layer
Of your childhood 
I was an archeologist
stumbling on Beautiful 
drawings of Robots
and Dark haired beauties
SciFi and Fantasy Books
were treasures left behind
for my consumption
Took your toy Millennium Falcon
On a trip to another galaxy
with Alf and Captain planet

[Chorus]
How can one person Be…
So many to me?...
Socrates to my questions
Devil's Advocate to my stances
You were my Uncle Dad Big Brother…
And my Best Friend Too…
I was the Destroyer
Of your Silence
Static to your Radio
Giant Lizard…
To your Chipmunk
