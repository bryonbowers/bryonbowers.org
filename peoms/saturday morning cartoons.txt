words dance out my mouth
a tingly tiny toon
a let loose swoony loon…
eyes locked..
on my favorite cartoon…
rambo red head ban on…
bazooka by my side
world a wonderful ride…
plastic hunting knife…
blue jean jacket pocket…
ready to pull
you to me…
orange pistol
in my hand
ready to defend
ready for that last…
grand stand…
Alf chases that damn cat
he wouldn't eat em like that
Would he?...
if i had a space ship
i'd fly to the moon with you
another galaxy…
where the wookies go
far away from this world…
I am a vampire now
sun shades on
allergic to the light
of the day
fake head ache turned on…
no longer of this world…
I am a boy…
no more…
Victory candy sig…
hanging out my mouth…
death stick in your hand
we plan our next feast
In this…
our hunting land…
we are apex…
the humans cattle…
we sharpen fangs
we talk as we walk slow…
to our cave at the end of the universe…
every pine needle resting
every twig set in its place
the sun shines slowly
through the tree canopy
hair falls covering eyes
I brush it aside…
two vampires
hiding from the sun and the world
as they fall into the forest ground…
two hearts frozen
worm food delivered
one buried deep… 
would make you shiver…
the other a vampire queen…
She flys over the world
Every night
Too old and too fast 
to ever be found…
I was a puppy dog
loved a small world with you
two gods…
wrapped up in vines and needles
playing with little dung beetles…
and rolly pollies…
dirt under blocks
dropped and crushed
all the way to the end of us
down the valley of overalls
under blue tarps
you were wendy passing by
two vampires in transit 
on a road to nowhere
with only the sun
to berate the gods in the end…
