no dogs allowed
no long pony tails
no tattoos on your neck
face or your arm
spill your milk carton
on the shiny immortal’s floor
here’s your access badge
and your self worth dollar
real tendrils
Into mind and body missing
only shiny rust laid on and old gold toy
gives you a moment’s rush and takes your joy
debtor’s prison
on an island of stuff….

[chorus]
Give it to me
Give it to me 
Give it to me now
Glow of the screen
“Put it down right now…”
“I would if I could…
But I don’t know how”

real connection…
lasts through space, time and death
when someone sees you with their eyes
they truly see you…
you can feel their mind rolling on yours
a moment of unease
then comfort
In the connection
the mingling of laughter
twinkle in an eye
happiness bubbling under the surface
waiting for its next fix
Shaking…
Scratching…
at your door
pounding to get in
pounding like thunder
fists bound in anger
and frustration
spread across time
and your face
a sting held in time

[chorus]
Give it to me
Give it to me 
Give it to me now
Glow of the screen
“Put it down right now…”
“I would if I could…
But I don’t know how”

hovering above the water like 2 dragon flies 
Mating on the backbone 
Death soon in their eyes…
control and conformity
Nature’s root
chaos at edge 
pulling us…
molding new creatures
made of carbon 
lattices spread across time
the whore of the chemical world
latching onto everything
like venom
an intergalactic simbiot
now part of us
we would die without the glow of the screen
the constant dopamine
Injected into our veins
riding that digital train
get off as soon as you can
cuz this train’s not stopping
until you lose your soul…

[chorus]
Give it to me
Give it to me 
Give it to me now
Glow of the screen
“Put it down right now…”
“I would if I could…
But I don’t know how”
