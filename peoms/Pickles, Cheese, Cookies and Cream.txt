Pickles, cheese, cookies and cream
The world is full of people who dream
Wonderful, Dreadful, Scary and Nice
Sometimes It’s lollipops on Ice
Sometimes It’s mice playing Dice

Climbin’ up the mountain
I got my gear
But the wind is 
Horribly Dreadful I fear
Tears drip frozen from the tip of my nose
To the underside belly of the tip of my toes

Out comes the Sun
So shiny and bright
I can finally see that good ol’ Daylight
Looks like we’re gonna have fun tonight

A Sun, A Beam, Jelly on Toast
May family and friends are what I love the most
Eating girl scout cookies
On a Sunday Afternoon
