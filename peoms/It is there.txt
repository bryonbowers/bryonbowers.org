Once it was here
And I was there
Now I am here…
And it…
It is there…
It is not me
It is not of me

[Chorus]
Honey pours down
from the shelf above me
Bees buzz around
my head, they are free
crawling on my skin
They dance in glee
warrior stingers dance
they are protecting me…

purple blooming sage
bees crawling a top
I keep it in a nest
warrior bees…
they dance…
all around it…
masked with funny sounds 
thought doors left ajar
honey piling on top
in giant golden mounds

[Chorus]
Honey pours down
from the shelf above me
Bees buzz around
my head, they are free
crawling on my skin
They dance in glee
warrior stingers dance
they are protecting me…

Smiles a top pain
honey coated for you
I hate you so much
but I love you too
I hear your voice
transport it there to here…
bee stingers dig
dig deep into skin
they do not protect
they are just like you
I am no longer here
I have floated away…
So high in the clouds…
where even bees can't go…

[Chorus]
Honey pours down
from the shelf above me
Bees buzz around
my head, they are free
crawling on my skin
They dance in glee
warrior stingers dance
they are protecting me…

let's pour your voice
into a bottle
of zero transparency
sealed with a living blue haired 
portuguese cork a top
bottle can float at sea
until I'm forced to search it out
and say words of thee
bottle you I can not
I have tried
I can hang with my bees 
now my protectors 
when your voice is far away
just buzzing around
smiling with their funny sounds 
dancing on golden honey mounds….

[Chorus]
Honey pours down
from the shelf above me
Bees buzz around
my head, they are free
crawling on my skin
They dance in glee
warrior stingers dance
they are protecting me…
