Watchin’ Cartoons
on a Lazy Saturday Morning
Volume’s down low
Don’t wanna wake up dad
Not sure what kinda week he had
Don’t wanna know
Friends knock at the door
It’s time to get out
for the weekend

[chorus]
Off to the moon
Down to the races
We gotta put our rides
through the paces
off to less sad
and happier places

Riding up and down
Our neighborhood street
No new people 
None to meet
Same ol’ thing as yesterday
Let’s jump in the woods
And let’s go play…

[chorus]
Off to the moon
Down to the races
We gotta put our rides
through the paces
off to less sad
and happier places

Birthday Party on a Rainy Day
We’ve run out of childish games to play
Dad said his last goodbye
Sit down little man 
Don’t you cry
We’re gonna hop on 
that rocket ship and fly…

[chorus]
Off to the moon
Down to the races
We gotta put our rides
through the paces
off to less sad
and happier places

Things changed little after he was gone
Mom was alive, but not in her head
She might as well have been dead
We were stealin’ Doctor Peppers 
From the corner store
I’ll sneak the snickers
While you watch the door
Sucking on fireballs
and Huffin’ on Paint
Wandering around
And staying up late

[chorus]
Off to the moon
Down to the races
We gotta put our rides
through the paces
off to less sad
and happier places
