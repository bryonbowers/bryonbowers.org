i tip toed to the edge of the cliff
to see you at the bottom…
and it broke my heart…
and made my eyes leak…
Next month…
Did it again…

[Chorus]
Sold the cow
to get to you…
Magic beans…
That never grew…
Forced Smiles
Served with Birthday cakes…
Sadness escaping 
Through my eyes…
Healing a Broken Heart…


My former self floating
In the back of my brain
Echos of your voice
Magic Jesus whispers
My little green frog 
on lay-a-away
Waiting for me
to return one day
Forever sitting on the shelf
In the back of a K-mart
Playing poker with a Teddy Ruxpin

[Chorus]
Sold the cow
to get to you…
Magic beans…
That never grew…
Forced Smiles
Served with Birthday cakes…
Sadness escaping 
Through my eyes…
Healing a Broken Heart…


You clung to God
Your magic beans
That never grew
Sad birthday cakes
I always smiled for you
Cried like a baby
each time I left you
Tried to control it
to no avail
My eyes refused
To listen to my mind.. 

[Chorus]
Sold the cow
to get to you…
Magic beans…
That never grew…
Forced Smiles
Served with Birthday cakes…
Sadness escaping 
Through my eyes…
Healing a Broken Heart…

Living in the land of Giants
Gold all around…
Promises made
But Never Kept…
Duct Tape on
Broken Windows
Emotions bubble 
Under my head
Tattered clothes
On wobbly knees
Can’t Take you with me
Get me out of here please!

[Chorus]
Sold the cow
to get to you…
Magic beans…
That never grew…
Forced Smiles
Served with Birthday cakes…
Sadness escaping 
Through my eyes…
Healing a Broken Heart…
