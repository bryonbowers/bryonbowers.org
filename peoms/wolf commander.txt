a gaggle of boys
you were just one girl
smoking cigarettes 
our minds in a whirl…
your back against the wall
you were looking’ lean
hair slicked back
your lip stick mean…
had us strutting’ about…
with our Collars up..
Vying for your attention
Bulls in a play pin…

[chorus]
pack of wolves
circling round you
got your scent
and your red lips too
peacocks a dancing
strutting’ for you…
Commander hips
my body bowed to you …


your every move
is their command
whatever you want
in the palm of your hand…
Flowers jewels
you rule their land
Legs flowing’ down
Red dress on…
Take your time
And answer your phone…

[Chorus]
pack of wolves
circling round you
got your scent
and your red lips too
peacocks a dancing
strutting’ for you…
Commander hips
my body bowed to you …



You got your pick
One, More, 
Or none at all
All lined up
They’re ready to fall..
Lift your axe
bring it on down
Heads gonna roll
that gurgle sound
Leashes attached 
to your big red lips
drag them along
throw em a bone
then take em home…

[Chorus]
pack of wolves
circling round you
got your scent
and your red lips too
peacocks a dancing
strutting’ for you…
commander hips
my body bowed to you …


Forest all around
Water gonna fall…
Dark clouds rolling in…
Scoreboard and all
Tents all around
You took my hand…
I bowed to you
queen of my land…
You Left….
Then you came back to me…
In the night
like a shadow
from the sea
gave you tribute
then I gave it again…
you released the hound in me……
…
Then I released the wolf in you…

[Chorus]
pack of wolves
circling round you
got your scent
and your red lips too
peacocks a dancing
strutting’ for you…
commander hips
my body bowed to you …
