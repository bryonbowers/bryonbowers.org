Your Eyes met Mine
We Didn’t need words
Bodies poised
In Our very own Universe..
Holding on
With all of my might…
Thought I’d lose myself
In you that night…

[chorus]
Holding’ On 
With all my might
You Pulled Me To you…
In the Dark of the Night..
Invisible strings
On Firefly light
Bumbling Kisses
Eyes made of Moonlight…

Invisible strings 
Connecting us
Your eyes
To my lips
My hands
To your hips
You in daisy dukes
Me in swimming trunks
Flower flip flops
And neon bracelets
Cannon Balls in the Pool
On my shoulders
You were my Chicken Head…

[chorus]
Holding’ On 
With all my might
You Pulled Me To you…
In the Dark of the Night..
Invisible strings
On Firefly light
Bumbling Kisses
Eyes made of Moonlight…



Adults by the fire
We crept to the forest…
Amongst the evergreens
And live oak trees
Bumbling kisses
My hands on your hips
Fireflies Flying
Taking Little trips…
Soft Lips…
Your Fingertips..
Moon in your eyes…

[chorus]
Holding’ On 
With all my might
You Pulled Me To you…
In the Dark of the Night..
Invisible strings
On Firefly light
Bumbling Kisses
Eyes made of Moonlight…

Next day Watermelons
at High noon…
Campers packing
They’re Going soon…
Your dad lowers…
Down your camper….
Our eyes meet
For the last time…
I watch you leave…
Two bodies in the Universe
Circled for a bit…
Now Parting…
Shooting back…
Into space…
Never Entangled Again….

[chorus]
Holding’ On 
With all my might
You Pulled Me To you…
In the Dark of the Night..
Invisible strings
On Firefly light
Bumbling Kisses
Eyes made of Moonlight…
