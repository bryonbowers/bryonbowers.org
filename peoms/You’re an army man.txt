grampa was a navy man always had a coffee In his hand keeping an eye on the ocean’s sky Looking for the rising sun [Chorus] At the end of the day we all lose our mind make sure to be kind and remember To rewind for those who come behind No girl back home He was free to roam from Old San Francisco to the blarney Stone He never talked about what he did On that grand Pacific Voyage Crossword Puzzles on every surface His scattered mind  Words in a furnace Ashes floatin’ in every direction Up, down, forward,  and far behind [Chorus] At the end of the day we all lose our mind make sure to be kind and remember To rewind for those who come behind Reading Louis La’more Sippin’ on Tea We just sat there  on the front porch swing Not a word was spoken More to say, but not today That just wasn't our way [Chorus] At the end of the day we all lose our mind make sure to be kind and remember To rewind for those who come behind Secret Mrs Baird's Pies Hidden behind the driver’s seat Of his old grey truck He had a hollow leg And so did I to the envy of My grama’s eye [Chorus] At the end of the day we all lose our mind make sure to be kind and remember To rewind for those who come behind I remember our last Family Friday Movie Night Before I took off to College We watched Adams Family Values Wednesday tried to kill Tuesday We had coffee ice cream and popcorn Saturday morning I was returning the VHS tape And the sign said [Chorus] At the end of the day we all lose our mind make sure to be kind and remember To rewind for those who come behind
