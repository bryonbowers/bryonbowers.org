Raisin Bran Milk
Banana cut with a spoon
Hurry my bones
bus coming soon
brute cologne
for a rendezvous

[chorus]
Another one gone…
Left me all alone..
Bodies all around…
a heart of stone…
Your body is here…
But your mind
Is gone…


morning time
alone with you
Darkness all around
We make not a sound
shuffle off our mortal coil
let it mix with the dirt and oil
seeds explorers of your fertile soil
name tags on
name spelled wrong
Legs shaking
Hard as stone…
I'm with you now
But still alone

[chorus]
Another one gone…
Left me all alone..
Bodies all around…
a heart of stone…
Your body is here…
But your mind
Is gone…



I wanted your mind
You gave me your body
you threw me to the side
you hurt my heart
not my pride
you never really let me inside
now this I know
It wasn't just the world keeping you from me
It was you hiding behind a wall no one could see


[chorus]
Another one gone…
Left me all alone..
Bodies all around…
a heart of stone…
Your body is here…
But your mind
Is gone…



I professed my love to you…
I saw a pity in your eyes for me
not regret for what could not be
but sympathy for what was not
You started moving away from me…
I saw it coming a mile away…
but I thought you might stay…
my love lingered…
another one gone…
my heart felt like stone…

[chorus]
Another one gone…
Left me all alone..
Bodies all around…
a heart of stone…
Your body is here…
But your mind
Is gone…
