I am laying
In the back of the van…
got the Talisman
In my hand..
the pages are flowing
down the highway
I'm going….
trees and power lines
creep across my eyes
as I think about her thighs
I pop in green day dookie
as she screams in silence
self esteem rages in my ears
as I drift off to sleep
while she dances in my head
I listen to their words
as they drive
50 years together
I can feel their love
I can feel their anger
2 people eating the world they know
carry countless burdens
I know some that don't show
What drives them
their daily bread
As meaning and purpose
bounce around their head
I listen more to what is said
you made a wrong turn!
must you breathe?
frustration and fatigue assail them
as twilight dusts the road’s horizon
We should stop soon and get dinner
or breakfast
I have lost track of time
In my joyous slumber
as we trek to the ocean
for our yearly summer migration
girls in bikinis
old women tanning
boys strutting about
the world waits for no one
and everyone at once
it is twirling yet still
an illusion of movement 
In space and time…
She dances back into my head
as I dream of another day
can see the sunlight
hit her face
every long and short hair in place
I do bid you farewell
from my memory 
now you must go
you don't have to go home…
but you can not stay here….
