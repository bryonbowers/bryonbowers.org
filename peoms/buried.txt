my body imprisoned 
beneath the earth
dirt thrown on top
the sound of my heart
my only companion
they had buried me
with a jar a piss lemonade
to quinch my thirst
seconds past
minutes
hours
darkness consumed me
as tears rolled down my cheeks
is this where I die
is this where I join him
and his broken heart

[Chorus]
a spec of light
shines in the void 
of my darkest night…
I saw the world 
early as I crawled…
out the ground
I could now see sound
fury wells up in me…
as I accept 
I am now a creature 
of the ground….


I could swear I saw his face once
In an early memory
How could a man of such anger
such violence on drunken Saturday nights….
hold a tiny infant in his arms and smile?
not just with mouth, but eyes too
How did he not crush me with his discontent?
they found him dead one morning
sitting in his lazy chair
heart stopped, was he holding me?
sometimes it feels like I am the main character
In a B movie…
everyone dies or exits stage left

[Chorus]
a spec of light
shines in the void 
of my darkest night…
I saw the world 
early as I crawled…
out the ground
I could now see sound
fury wells up in me…
as I accept 
I am now a creature 
of the ground….


I slowly accept that they have forgotten me down here
I am now a creature beneath the earth
This is where I will draw my last breath
acceptance nestles into my bones
as I lay down and close my eyes
a small dot of light appears
enters my dark void of fears…
my heart skips
I start sobbing from joy of rescue
a subtle sadness creeps in 
that i would not be meeting him…

[Chorus]
a spec of light
shines in the void 
of my darkest night…
I saw the world 
early as I crawled…
out the ground
I could now see sound
fury wells up in me…
as I accept 
I am now a creature 
of the ground….


I am angry now
lashing out at them…
as I sob
they laugh….
their cackles grim…
Cruelty sweet nectar
to their childish delight…
I am left now in the forest
free from the ground
looking up at clouds
my mind resting now
I can see sound now…
it is a spec of light
In the darkness of the void…

[Chorus]
a spec of light
shines in the void 
of my darkest night…
I saw the world 
early as I crawled…
out the ground
I could now see sound
fury wells up in me…
as I accept 
I am now a creature 
of the ground….
hearing every sound…
