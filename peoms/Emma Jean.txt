Emma Jean and the Mr. Gobble School Bus Show

“Got my thrill on blueberry hill”
Playing’ on the radio
Mr. Gobble does side willies
On his school bus show..

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me

Bus packed like sardines
You always sat next to me…
Your smile was contagious
Your pinches made me blush
Playful eyes locked
You were flirting with me

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me


You were older and funny
You made cloudy days sunny
We saved our straws for spit balls
On the ceiling and the walls
Sunflower seeds all over the floor
Older kids talking’ to you
Trying to get your number and score

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me


Last day of school
Bus pulled over 
Water balloon fight in the park
Your wet t-shirt clinging to you
My blue jeans just got smaller
And I think i just got taller

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me

You moved away that summer
I didn’t even know
Got onto the bus that morning
You didn’t show
That’s ok, people they come
And then people tend to go
Welcome to Mr. Gobble’s 
Final School Bus Show

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me

[Fade Out]

Bus packed like sardines
You always sat next to me…
Your smile was contagious
Your pinches made me blush
Playful eyes locked
You were flirting with me

[Chorus]
Emma Jean had the Sweetest Lips 
This boy had ever seen
2 sparklin’ brown eyes
and Big ol’ dimples 
Sittin’ next to me
