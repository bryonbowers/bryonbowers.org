we were summer campers marching
through the woods mid day
sitting on buckets
we started to play…
you were sneaky smiles
creasing dimples at me
didn’t catch a fish
but I did catch you

[chorus]
you were a tall drink of water
walking to the watering hole
daisy dukes on
with your fishing pole
couldn’t catch a fish
but I could catch 
me with you…
Creatures of the moon
Losing their minds by the ice machine…

daylight white dress 
your favorite bible verse
night time dark corner 
you were my universe…
moon is shining
movie is on
kisses on your neck
smooth goosebumps 
my fingers on your legs…
You whisper “meet me at 3 by the ice machine”

[chorus]
you were a tall drink of water
walking to the watering hole
daisy dukes on
with your fishing pole
couldn’t catch a fish
but I could catch 
me with you…
Creatures of the moon
Losing their minds by the ice machine…



you were my crazy mind
female dopple ganger
crazy on the edge
with a bit of stranger
words flowing out your mouth
your mind out of my range
your powers of persuasion 
melted me
brought me into the night
you brought me to my knees
two creatures of the moon
by the ice machine

[chorus]
you were a tall drink of water
walking to the watering hole
daisy dukes on
with your fishing pole
couldn’t catch a fish
but I could catch you…
Creatures of the moon
Losing their minds
by the ice machine…


[chorus]
you were a tall drink of water
walking to the watering hole
daisy dukes on
with your fishing pole
couldn’t catch a fish
but I could catch 
me with you…
Creatures of the moon
Losing their minds by the ice machine…
mind all wobbly 
your silhouette against the moon
razor sharp as you walked away…
you took my mind
you blew it away…
while the moon was shining
like the light of the day…
I laid down flat
talked to the moon, 
sounds of the forest
morning coming soon…
creatures all around
of every kind
your body only thing 
on this creature’s mind!!

[chorus]
you were a tall drink of water
walking to the watering hole
daisy dukes on
with your fishing pole
couldn’t catch a fish
but I could catch 
me with you…
Creatures of the moon
Losing their minds by the ice machine…
