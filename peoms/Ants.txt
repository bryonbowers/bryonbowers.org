Long ago on 
a weekend trip
South Padre Island
Spent the day 
looking at birds
with my grama 
and grampa
Forest Pocket 
In the trees
Sitting’ on Benches
Silent Jumpers
All around us
Back at the hotel
Walking Fritzy on the Beach
You were smoking
With your friends 
You squeaked 
and kissed my dog
You said
“Come hang with us tonight…”

[Chorus]
Jumped early in your car…
Tied the Race With you on the Beach…
Under the light of the moon
Embers of the morning light..
Fire burned out in the night…
Tire Tracks now…
Where you once were…
Hope you found Your Happiness

That night 
I wondered out
to the beach 
Fire Burning High
We were drinking hard
You took me back…
To your car
Jumped too soon
My face was red..
You still burning hot
“It's ok”, is what you said
Other things…
That we can do…

[Chorus]
Jumped early in your car…
Tied the Race With you on the Beach…
Under the light of the moon
Embers of the morning light..
Fire burned out in the night…
Tire Tracks now…
Where you once were…
Hope you found Your Happiness

Under the moon…
Further down the beach…
You talked of your life 
back at home
Dad was always angry 
Mom was always drunk
You couldn’t wait 
To leave that town
I got your number
We parted ways…
I stumbled to the hotel pool
Pretend to lounge 
In the morning sun
Said I woke up early
For a swim

[Chorus]
Jumped early in your car…
Tied the Race With you on the Beach…
Under the light of the moon
Embers of the morning light..
Fire burned out in the night…
Tire Tracks now…
Where you once were…
Hope you found Your Happiness

We met up throughout the years
Lost touch…
Went our separate ways
You met somebody
Had some kids
I went to college
Life moves on…

[Chorus]
Jumped early in your car…
Tied the Race With you on the Beach…
Under the light of the moon
Embers of the morning light..
Fire burned out in the night…
Tire Tracks now…
Where you once were…
Hope you found Your Happiness
