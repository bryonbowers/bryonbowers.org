I'm folding’ clothes
I'm folding’ clothes
folding clothes
For how long
No one knows
Folding’ clothes ‘til the day I die

Folding clothes that my children wear
Tshirts pants and underwear 
I've been folding clothes 
Since the day they were born
Wrapped em tight 
Burrito Style
Then we slept a little while

Cycle this
And cycle that
Start it up
Shaking Now
Is it dry?
It's not somehow
Put it back
Run Again
