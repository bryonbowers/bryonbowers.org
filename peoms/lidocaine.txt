needle going in…
3 lidocaines…
Kate from Massachusetts
says your body can't move
but your mouth can say fuck all day…

[Chorus]
Lidocaine
Seeping’ In
Close my eyes
it's the knife again
See it 
don't feel it…
It's Going in…
That's what she said…
You can say 
Fuck all day…



“You can say fuck all day”
That's what she said
Keep your body still
I'm gonna cut you open
with some 5 inch steel
It's about to get really
really real
I bit my fucking lip
then I fucking looked away…

[Chorus]
Lidocaine
Seeping’ In
Close my eyes
it's the knife again
See it 
don't feel it…
It's Going in…
That's what she said
You can say
Fuck all day…


Body Tensed
Fuck my life right now
Gutted like a fish
Or a savory cow
Served up
Her nightly medical dish
she looked up
with delight
she was smiling now
at my painful plight
tried to move my finger
But it didn't feel right…

[Chorus]
Lidocaine
Seeping’ In
Close my eyes
it's the knife again
See it 
don't feel it…
It's Going in…
That's what she said
You can say
Fuck all day…

I walk out…
into the night…
bloody middle finger
wrapped up tight
she said “soak it in some salt
warm water too
if it gets worse
come back to me”
In a day or two
Fuck my day
Fuck you too
Finger got sliced 
Sliced in two

[Chorus]
Lidocaine
Seeping’ In
Close my eyes
it's the knife again
See it 
don't feel it…
It's Going in…
That's what she said
You can say
Fuck all day…
