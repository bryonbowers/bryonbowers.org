In a building
No longer standing
Lives the ghosts of college past
A blonde bombshell…
Wakefulness Fading fast…
Leans back in her office chair
Purchase orders sprinkled everywhere 
stamps the paper
licks the stamp
a little longer than necessary…
makes you feel a little stronger…
Her name
from another generation
Her frugality encased 
in every lunch brown paper bag…
Her mind locked on her lover…
As I gather my paper
I…the paper delivery boy
to every printer
In every building
while my mp3 player spits
Harry’s Taxi into my daily jaunt
meeting a past love by chance
on a rainy day…
at the gas station
on the way to class
an Aggie visiting long horn land
What are the chances?
Of all the places in the Universe?
Your hair was shorter 
But your eyes…
were still your eyes…
Your smile…
still your smile…
We hugged and said some words…
He seemed nice…
We said our goodbye again…
The heart was…
well…
That was that…
Life moves and shuffles us along
Like kayakers in the ocean
With a great white on our tail
If you stop paddling
you’re bound to fail
Youth is wasted on the young
Wisdom wasted on the old
Or so I'm told
If you can help it
Don't get old
drink the elixir of immortality 
called contentment 
love is kinda like the universe
It's unlimited
Hate and Regret have a very short shelf life
and provide little joy…
Except to the heartless and insane
Love when you can
Stretch often
Sleep under the stars at least once in your life
Give and you receive in life…
and in bed…
Walk without an umbrella 
Get soaked in the rain…
Insert a little random 
Into your daily routine
The mind craves anomalies
and delicious food
Be nice
Don't be rude
and if you ever find yourself 
driving away from a racist
that waves at you
feel free to flip that asshole off
with a clear fuck you middle finger
emphasise it too 
by moving it forward 
give it a little shake
or two….
With wild crazy…
Fuck you eyes at full mast!
