Red scarf around your neck
One fingerless glove on
Adverse to haste
Your destination is Unknown
A dancer and a dreamer
15 minutes late
No breakfast
On your plate
just a cereal bar
on the ride in dad’s car 

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by 
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…


Ham and PBJ
In your lunchbox
Everyday
You’re a fish in water
and a Butterfly on the land
Guardian of the creatures
Protector of your little brother
Worried about everything 
More than you should be
Everything’s gonna be ok
just enjoy your day

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by 
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…


Swimming in the pool with dad
Playing the Dragon Game
Holding on for dear life
Trying to keep feet on the other side
Marco said to Polo
Where did you go go?
Time to get out
Bed time comes
Can't turn it off?
I’ll read a poem for you..
The Sun fell out of the sky
The moon began to cry
It cried so hard
A thunderstorm formed…
Rain came down so hard
and so long
That a river formed
And turned into this song
And flowed all the way 
to your ears…
sleep now
get your rest
let me take care of the rest…

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
for a slow walk
Anywhere with you…
Take their life slow
Let your stress go…
Because childhood passes by 
way too fast…
You gotta Hug em and kiss em
and make the time last…
