Looking’ in the mirror at my crazy blonde hair.. lice crawling’ ‘around everywhere Blue Eyes Wild Looking back at me... nose bombarded by the smell of pee… Front door slams open It’s case worker Carla.. The cops pick us up… we kick and scream… calming us down… with some chocolate ice cream… we’re driving away… tears in our eyes.. looking back at that dark night sky… wondering why we had to say goodbye… [Chorus] New Place New Clothes New Hair Cut same old wild blue eyes… Staring’ back at me… Opened my eyes.. Where am I now? What is this place… Clean carpet…  and spotless floors… Granite counter tops… figurines behind glass… Strangers say “Good Morning” I don't know you Where's my mom? Why am I here? [Chorus] New Place New Clothes New Hair Cut same old wild blue eyes… Staring’ back at me… New place In the night… Clothes in a garbage bag Hot Wheels car In my jean pocket… Wake up next morning Hand-me-down star wars pajamas A quiet old man… He’s drinking coffee.. A sweet old woman.. with big glasses on… is cooking corned beef hash… I think I'm done… moving ‘round this world I think I’m done… carrying ‘round this bag This place feels like home.. [Chorus] New Place New Clothes New Hair Cut same old wild blue eyes… Staring’ back at me… Only difference now… Is the smell of corned beef hash on toast And those two old souls Loving’ back at me Lost looking for…  their coconut tree….
