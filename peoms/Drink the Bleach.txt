[Chorus]
Don’t be a Bitch 
Just Drink the Bleach
Drink the Bleach 
Drink the Bleach

Mix it with some Kool Aid
And drink the Bleach
Drink the Bleach
Drink the Bleach

Drink it on a Lovely Summer Day
While the Puppies play
Drink the Bleach 
Drink the Bleach

Drink it in the Moonlight
On the Beach 
Drink the Bleach 
Drink the Bleach

Drink it while your Laundry
Turns and Sways
Turns and sways
Turns and sways

Drink it while the Dryer
Dries your Soul
Dries your Soul
Dries your Soul

Drink it while the People
Pay the Toll
Pay the Toll
Pay the Toll

Two Big Cons
Paid and Won
Good for you
Good for you

[Chorus]
Don’t be a Bitch 
Just Drink the Bleach
Drink the Bleach 
Drink the Bleach
