Asked you a question and You stole my Soul…. Then you picked curtains To hang in my brain My teenage self Sneaking  Into your office locked… and down your back stairs… You moved away No forwarding address Left my brain In distress [Chorus] You climbed up Into my Brain… Your body wrapped me in Cellophane… Office, Apartment,  And in your Car… You moved away, but you didn’t go far… You’re still paying rent in my Brain… Driving me just a little Insane…. Exposed my brain To your elegant scalpel  Checked your boxes… I was a worm in your apple… Lessons learned… No heads turned… Knowing Smiles Exchanged… Our meetings you arranged… Smart, clever, with a level head Popcorn on your couch Watching “The Living Dead”... [Chorus] You climbed up Into my Brain… Your body wrapped me in Cellophane… Office, Apartment,  And in your Car… You moved away, but you didn’t go far… You’re still paying rent in my Brain… Driving me just a little Insane…. Smoke flowing from your nose on me My finger tips on your knee… You made fun of my van… I said “that shit turns your lungs black”.... You said, “humans are a cosmic blink”... Now your lost to me In time and space Probably got some wrinkles on your face Im older now I see you differently I see my younger self reaching… For something I didn't have Attempting to fill the void Keeping everyone at a safe distance From my fragile heart… But I failed… I let you in… Now it's Time to say goodbye again… It was fun, I had a blast… I should’ve known it wouldn't last… [Chorus] You climbed up Into my Brain… Your body wrapped me in Cellophane… Office, Apartment,  And in your Car… You moved away, but you didn’t go far… You’re still paying rent in my Brain… Driving me just a little Insane….
