the fearless one
of knitting needles
reached inside
and pulled out the lion’s aching tooth
simplicity, elegance, demure 
with a touch of aloof
a kind heart
with music eyes
and a new mustache
two young people
a glimpse of future’s past
rolling around
a fluffy brown couch
as they planned their escape
children poured
from every corner
everyone around them
long into the thick of it
Halloween hangovers
and to do lists in their heads…

[Chorus]
Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion’s mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again



a delicious feast before them
prepared by the goddess of war
and cherished friends 
warriors of the species
the skeleton bride hands out mushrooms
while green crystals fall from trees of sound
he plays on the beach with wild abandon
not a care in the world…
while Igor and Dr Frankenstein's grand daughter
regal my mind of Bradbury tales of old
stories flowing of dwarves and jars
horror movie of youth floats up
one twin dies
the other takes his place
twin brain floating in a jar
inside and abandoned old barn


[Chorus]
Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion’s mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again


the goddess of elegance sits beside me
with her tequila silence
and thoughts of things to do
as the children watch spirits of machines
wonder a world of killer machines
Fine dining
on a Michelin star
Chicago skyline
after the fire beauty arose
humanity flexing its mind muscle
built of cattle proceeds nexus powers
and a world connected
goodbyes said
we close the door
the goddess and our two loves
fall into a slumber
an elf toils
love is strange
colt 45
a great growler with a banjo
spits out lead belly cobain lost pines
into my mind
as darkness comes in
and thoughts dance to a slow stop
on these pages of your time …

[Chorus]
Two young ones
species all around…
The fearless one
reaching into the lion’s mouth
Children watching killer machines
as Bradbury tales ride on Michelin stars
while Lead belly Cobain lost pines
are Growled into the universe once again
