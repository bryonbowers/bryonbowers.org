Running’ hard
Round and Round
Dirt on my shoe…
Sweat pouring down
drenched in your smile…
a Click as I pass by
Feathers on the wall
You got me feeling’ tall…

[chorus]
I’m a dirty dog
always one bell
away from you
I wanted your mind 
and your body too
1 mississippi, 2 and 3
Let’s hit the floor 
with you and me?

Dwindling down
Now just me and him
“Johny Be Good” plays
Smooth out the speakers
Echoing off the walls…
Smiling Now...
Don’t wanna to win
Just wanna please her.
im a dog….
on a jump rope leash
waiting for a treat
Out of breath…
Collapsed to the floor
Entered worlds between

[chorus]
I’m a dirty dog
always one bell
away from you
I wanted your mind 
and your body too
1 mississippi, 2 and 3
Let’s hit the floor 
with you and me?

Line of exhaustion…
waiting for drips
1 mississippi
2 and 3
Sneak another one…
Then one more…
More behind me…
Tired as can be…
heads hit the floor 
with the same dull thud
Into the ether…
head lost in mud….

[chorus]
I’m a dirty dog
always one bell
away from you
I wanted your mind 
and your body too
1 mississippi, 2 and 3
Let’s hit the floor 
with you and me?


Fleeing scholars
Final Bell…
Excitement, Relief…
Running Hounds of Hell
Trickle in
they burn their knowledge
stow mine away
Treasures from you to me…
Walk out the building…
She falls away…

[chorus]
I’m a dirty dog
always one bell
away from you
I wanted your mind 
and your body too
1 mississippi, 2 and 3
Let’s hit the floor 
with you and me?

Missing you in the summer heat
TV boy am I
Outer limits
Space traps too
Aliens melting 
metal through…
Star wars
Star Trek
stories he adores…
But none compare to yours
I’ve read them 
many many times…
added notes and a question for you 
when the summer heat is through…

[chorus]
I’m a dirty dog
always one bell
away from you
I wanted your mind 
and your body too
1 mississippi, 2 and 3
Let’s hit the floor 
with you and me?
