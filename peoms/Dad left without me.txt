Monday morning
Time for School
You said 
“Wake up sleepy head”
“It's time to Seize the day”
I pulled the covers over my head
I'm no Caesar, Go away
We were walking out the door
Back inside
For a Banana 
Come back out
Car was gone
Dad left without me…

[Chorus]
Seize the day
Pull back the covers
Dad just drove away
Left me standing 
By the front door
Next




I rampage into the house
And tell my mom
What happened
She called my dad
And let him know
He says…
I thought he was in the car
I heard two seat belts click
He says
We're close to school
And we can't turn back
And he says
Honey can you take him to school
Me and my mom
Race to the car
And drive to school.

[Chorus]
After school
We have a chat
About how they abandoned me
My dad makes up an excuse 
About the two seat belt clicks
And I say it's fine
When it's really not that fine.
