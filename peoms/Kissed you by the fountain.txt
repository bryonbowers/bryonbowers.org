I was a Wolf walking 
with you hand in hand
You an innocent sheep
In my hard wolf land…
“Can I kiss you”
Said the wolf to the sheep
“No”, said the sheep
With a twinkle in her smile
And a bo in her peep
You were a wolf
In sheep's clothing
You kissed
me by the fountain 
Outside world…
Melting away..
Just you and me…
Two wolves…
At play…
On a winter day…

[Chorus]
Sheep clothing On the Dorm Room Floor
Two wolves Kissing
Looking for more
Love, then Love
Then They Love some more…
Now there’s Two cubs playing
On the Brick house Floor


I kissed you…
By the fountain
On the 4th of July
I kissed you
On the top of a hill
Then we had a good thrill
I kissed you
Then I fell in love with you

[Chorus]
Sheep clothing On the Dorm Room Floor
Two wolves Kissing
Looking for more
Love, then Love
Then They Love some more…
Now there’s Two cubs playing
On the Brick house Floor

Two wolves had 
Two baby cubs
Built a house 
made of bricks and love
Hail and Stone rained down
It huffed, and puffed,
But it didn't blow
The house down…

[Chorus]
Sheep clothing On the Dorm Room Floor
Two wolves Kissing
Looking for more
Love, then Love
Then They Love some more…
Now there’s Two cubs playing
On the Brick house Floor
