Tripping on Ginkgo Biloba
Watching a wave of indecision
Smash down
A world where work smothers us
While our children yearn for one more minute
One more ounce of childhood by the pool
One more game of hide and seek
We pulled back to the chains of capitalism
The next generation recognizing
all the problems of the world
deciding not to replicate
complicate
Easiest path taken
To the end of the yellow road
No ruby red slippers at the end
Just the cold embrace of death
But in between there’s more
have them
It's hard
I know
But in the great words
Of the dazed and confused poet
“keep living”
And in the great words he found on the floor of a frathouse
“I will persist until I succeed.”
“I will greet this day with love in my heart.” 
“I will laugh at the world.”
“Today I begin a new life.”
Sometimes the day is long
The work is grueling
And your boss isn't paying you jack shit to meet the rent
Bide your time
Eat a Ramen
Your time is coming
You disenfranchised 
You generation of Apathy and Discontent
The “every politician is corrupt” reason is no longer valid
Donald Trump has set the bar so low
That the pool of people more moral and good for our country has increased exponentially 
Get the fuck out there
Vote the fascists out
Build your dream
Build it from your passions
From your family
From the love that wells inside of you
Not from a God
Or from a false Cheeto orange fascist blow hard small dick chaos agent hell bent on world destruction
You are the future of humanity 
Make your own world
Minecraft Style
Even if your parents struggled in a world with you
They can’t imagine a world without you…
You are loved
You are Potential and Perseverance
Turned into Power and Change
Don't let that powerful love go to waste
Go forth, make the world yours!
