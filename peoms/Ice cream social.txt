your chaos smooth…
order frozen blue 
back room with you
nice home
mind nestled deep…
I see you grin…
I’m stopped now 
cut to keeps
floors wear
as the house wife weeps

[ Chorus ]
Monster Twitches
Now Frozen Smooth
Mind nestled in
A quiver
A finish
A woman’s smile
Sparkly Girl eyes
With a Devil’s grin…

down here
where the people walk
they judge with eyes
back home they talk
my body laying
In Lines of chalk
Ice cream social
your legs on my ears
Vanilla,
Cinnamon, 
Cucumber melon,
foot steps go by

[ Chorus ]
Monster Twitches
Now Frozen Smooth
Mind nestled in
A quiver
A finish
A woman’s smile
Sparkly Girl eyes
With a Devil’s grin…



a quiver…
a finish…
curtains drawn…
the actor tongue in cheek
Picks up the rose
office letters strewn about
a woman smiles with girl eyes
as breathing subsides
back to civilization
where judgement resides…

 

[ Chorus ]
Monster Twitches
Now Frozen Smooth
Mind nestled in
A quiver
A finish
A woman’s smile
Sparkly Girl eyes
With a Devil’s grin…


walking out
amongst the people
world sparkles
spoons clink bowls
hair falls
shoulders move…
move slow…
only you
you and me know…
how to make the world go slow…
how much my heart 
you took with you…
you probably don't even know…
I could see you dancing slowly
My heart in your hand
blood dripping onto your pretty wood floor
A slip and slide for my body of youth…
a monster twitches
waiting for your kissing booth…

[ Chorus ]
Monster Twitches
Now Frozen Smooth
Mind nestled in
A quiver
A finish
A woman’s smile
Sparkly Girl eyes
With a Devil’s grin…
