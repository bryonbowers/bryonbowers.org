An edible fruit basket
On our doorstep
A side of pizza and Whisky too
I heard you lost her…
didn’t know what to say
words eluded me
a coward to face your loss
I could hardly face my own
who am i to comfort you
If i can’t comfort myself
see you after
long after
too long
we drink our feelings
onto the floor
toxic pain expunged
In tears and vomit
a confession of sorrow
pours out of me
two drunkards 
drinking their feelings
better than the pain of loss
morning brings light
Sadness still there
But my lack of action
Maybe atoned?
I don’t know
I can still feel his sorrow
a pain underneath
he has found happiness
In family and purpose
a lover of humanity
but solace in your solitude
an explorer of the universe
lacking only a spaceship
the darkness of space awaits…
