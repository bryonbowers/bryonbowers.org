Taste of your leaf
You were Smoke held in…..
Swish you around’.
Tasted you again…..
you drove me home
I asked it of you
my young soul 
gave it to you
I took you there
Your hands in my hair
Cold Winter on my skin
I wanna do it again…

[Chorus]
Questions asked
and Answered too
I wanna curl up
In Time with you
Car glass on a wintry night
two lovers on a midnight flight
One in the CIA
The other MIA


Back home
I'm in my bed
Your body swirling’...
In my head…
Your skin… 
Is still on mine…
Coating the surface of my mind
Never gonna sleep again
Til I can maybe hold your hand…

[Chorus]
Questions asked
and Answered too
I wanna curl up
In Time with you
Car glass on a wintry night
two lovers on a midnight flight
One in the CIA
The other MIA


In the shadows
We did creep
I was an agent in the CIA
then I made you go MIA
I guess I moved a little too fast
We said no strings attached
I just wanted a good time too
Then I fucked up…
Fell in love with you
You knew the world better than me
That now I see…
But that doesn't change
what's inside of me
My heart pounded when I saw you
Now it doesn't know what to do without you….

[Chorus]
Questions asked
and Answered too
I wanna curl up
In Time with you
Car glass on a wintry night
two lovers on a midnight flight
One in the CIA
The other MIA

I wanna do it again
Then do it again
Til the world comes
to its ultimate end…
On the Side the road
You can find me there…
I’ll be waiting for you
In love’s Fool chair…
Still Pounding Hard…
Still looking for you…..

[Chorus]
Questions asked
and Answered too
I wanna curl up
In Time with you
Car glass on a wintry night
two lovers on a midnight flight
One in the CIA
The other MIA

Standing in the bleaches
I could see you there…
I wanted to hold your hand
On that game night…
While the trumpets flared
And the Doves took flight…
The Prom Queen got her flowers that night…
The bleachers filled to the brim...
But all I could see…
was you…
with him…
