late one night
I held my post
looking for
that Santa Ghost
christmas stars
shining bright
chimney filled
with soft fire light
no Santa
in my sleepy sight
I stalked behind 
the christmas tree
eye lids heavy
my dog with me
carrots out…
milk and cookies too

[chorus]
I held my post
looking for…
that Santa Ghost
like the god
who never speaks
must be busy
Not helping
The poor and the weak
Gotta make your own happy
And Have yourself a lovely Day!

a one way conversation
with gods that never speak
learned early in life
you have to make your own happy…
contradictions and suffering Galore…
If this is the grand plan
you should brain storm some more
people suffer
empathy under Attack
scrooge in the White House
this plan is stupid and wack

[chorus]
I held my post
looking for…
that Santa Ghost
like the god
who never speaks
must be busy
Not helping
The poor and the weak
Gotta make your own happy
And Have yourself a lovely Day!

eventually i drift off
fell asleep at my post
I have missed that Santa Ghost
Christmas morning
presents…
a moment of new fleeting joy
with new stuff to play
new stuff to do…
newness fades… 
as all things do…
happy mustered from some place inside
keeping that creeping sadness at bay..
as the world fades to a lovely winter grey…
I stand up
and welcome a new happy godless day…

[chorus]
I held my post
looking for…
that Santa Ghost
like the god
who never speaks
must be busy
Not helping
The poor and the weak
Gotta make your own happy
And Have yourself a lovely Day!
