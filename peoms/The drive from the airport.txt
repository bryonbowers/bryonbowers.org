Sadness and Anger
Well up in me
Your Heavy Foot 
Pressing down on my voice…
Short, Curt, Clench of the Fist
I have lost her
Where are you?...
I have lost a love
You did too!
Do you feel?
Can you love?
Is it riding a wave….
inside you unseen?
Do you feel it?
Can you see it?
Her Stories were relayed…
Portuguese Dinners made…
Saturday calls..
To a slow meal hum…
bagels with creamcheese…
And then some…

[Chorus]
Death has come
It follows near
Love on mind
Wave in ear…
Lost a Love
Forever and True…
Now my thoughts
Well up inside…
Floating on waves…
Unseen you hide…
Trying to get 
Just a little peek…
At your stoic heart
Hiding within…

To the Pool
Floaties on…
Pink sun screen
On my nose…
Deep end looming near
Jumped in
Overcame my fear
Darkness at the bottom
Ladders on the side
Jumped over and over
While she reads Grisham and King…
Watermelons and Tea
Then Back in for me….

[Chorus]
Death has come
It follows near
Love on mind
Wave in ear…
Lost a Love
Forever and True…
Now my thoughts
Well up inside…
Floating on waves…
Unseen you hide…
Trying to get 
Just a little peek…
At your stoic heart
Hiding within…


Towel is waving out 
the back car window…
A freedom flag…
Declaring victory over the day…
She talked of Portuguese Pride
And her New Jersey Days…
Summer Fading fast…
Each year…
Never meant to last…
Dog days of summer linger
Spreading Spanish moss
On Magnolia trees…
Two lover’s initials’ 
Carved on the side…
Great limbs limbering down
Flexing for a hundred years…
Circle of dirt all around
AbraCaDabra…
Round and round..
Crazy eyes…
And Dirty paws…
She’s left this world
She left it…
Now It’s just
You and Me…
Riding on Waves Unseen…
Riding on Waves Unseen...

[Chorus]
Death has come
It follows near
Love on mind
Wave in ear…
Lost a Love
Forever and True…
Now my thoughts
Well up inside…
Floating on waves…
Unseen you hide…
Trying to get 
Just a little peek…
At your stoic heart
Hiding within…
