you moved away
I remember the day
you were with me
then you went away
I found you first
thought you loved me more
he was in your world
I was in there too

[Chorus]
A demon summoned
Now released
Servant’s heart sacrificed
You did me wrong
But you did me right
glad you released me 
from you that night

turns out I was just a body
summoned like a demon
on hollows eve
at your beckon call
no more
I poured my guts out
onto the floor
a servant sacrifice
run away with me
I can be your vice
we can live where no one knows
we could do all that stuff they call nice
I could find work
I don't need a degree
all we need is just you with me

[Chorus]
A demon summoned
Now released
Servant’s heart sacrificed
You did me wrong
But you did me right
glad you released me 
from you that night


childish dreams 
of a childish mind
released of my master
no longer tethered to you
no more summons
no more nights with you
my heart was bruised 
but not dead
although you still
wonder about a demon’s head
my love for you
now gone and dead
