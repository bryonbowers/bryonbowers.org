I'm just a number
jumping from here
to there
peel back my skin
numbers spill out
onto a dirty floor
filled with cardboard
and micro plastics
a fat little orange man
tears down the people's house
symbology dripping from his greedy smile
that never meets his eyes
the empty eyes of a mindless troll
emerging from under the bridge
demanding your loyalty 
while destroying your community
with hate and fear of change
why do people with love in their hearts
or any shred of dignity swear fealty 
to such a specimen
lacking all decency and heart
he attempts to wear the skin of Jesus
but it doesn't fit
his actions and words
divide and hurt the world
everything he does
the opposite of what Jesus would do
what would the clown king do?
