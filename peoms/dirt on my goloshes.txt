i sneak out
late at night
moon in the sky
owl in the tree
dirt on my goloshes
and grass underneath
cows mooing nearby
horses in the stable
I say hello
I forgot to water you
the day before
I apologize 
and run the hose

[Chorus]
free to roam
by the moon light
water running 
monsters in shadows
where i go next
nobody knows
I’ll just mosey around
a little greedy silent 
in my sound

a monster in every shadow
a creature near every tree
as I race back
I ponder
will she know?
will she be mad?
I stop in my tracks
How would she know
if I am quiet
and sneaky as a fox
the night is mine
I can mosey
and take my time…

[Chorus]
free to roam
by the moon light
water running 
monsters in shadows
where i go next
nobody knows
I’ll just mosey around
a little greedy silent 
in my sound



To the barn for gumballs
up the stairs
Unscrew the top
yummies in my pocket
chew a few
don't be greedy
some for my brothers
a few more for me…

[Chorus]
free to roam
by the moon light
water running 
monsters in shadows
where i go next
nobody knows
I’ll just mosey around
a little greedy silent 
in my sound

door creeks open
house is silent
I tip toe through the kitchen
smell of gumbo from the night before
fills my nostrils
I climb back into bed
morning comes
My brave night journey
hidden from the world
the shadows were just shadows
no vampires
no wolves
Just the hoot of owls hunting
I was no longer afraid of the night
but I was still very afraid of her…

[Chorus]
free to roam
by the moon light
water running 
monsters in shadows
where i go next
nobody knows
I’ll just mosey around
a little greedy silent 
in my sound

[Chorus]
free to roam
by the moon light
water running 
monsters in shadows
where i go next
nobody knows
I’ll just mosey around
a little greedy silent 
in my sound
