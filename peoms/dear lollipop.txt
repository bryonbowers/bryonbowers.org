[Chorus] Wiggle while they jiggle in the tiggle and boo Watch out for fear it’ll wiggle in you Then the anger’s gonna come on in there too Watch out baby it's coming for you On Lafayette Square, the Devil Don't Care Lollipop, Dear I have this horrible…terrible Fear That the world we hold dear Is about to disappear  Now I'm running from Johnny law Trying not to break my fall My cell phone needs charging My battery's run out My mind is screaming  I gotta get out  [Chorus] Wiggle while they jiggle in the tiggle and boo Watch out for fear it’ll wiggle in you Then the anger’s gonna come on in there too Watch out baby it's coming for you On Lafayette Square, the Devil Don't Care People protest on Lafayette Square Love for country held up in the air Bibles held upside down Now he wants his fucking crown He's tricking the believers  and surprising his schemers Even he can't believe what he's doing All the people he’ll be screwing [Chorus] Wiggle while they jiggle in the tiggle and boo Watch out for fear it’ll wiggle in you Then the anger’s gonna come on in there too Watch out baby it's coming for you On Lafayette Square, the Devil Don't Care 1500 violent out give me my guns they all shout Now the Bad hunts the Good That protected who they should The love between families sinks While the devil looks at the camera and winks He’s playing his flute loud as can be As they all blindly march out to the sea [Chorus] Wiggle while they jiggle in the tiggle and boo Watch out for fear it’ll wiggle in you Then the anger’s gonna come on in there too Watch out baby it's coming for you On Lafayette Square, the Devil Don't Care What will be left for our kids, no body knows I'm sure there will be sand where they can wiggle their toes While the world burns in the last of its throes Make sure you get a selfie  That no one will ever see….
