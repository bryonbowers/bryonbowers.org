Legs propped up…
Eyes closed…
Night wind on my face…
Taking turns at the wheel
High on Gasoline fumes
Cigarette Hotel Rooms
Laughing Our balls Off
We were Tripping on High
Reached the West coast
Threw up in the ocean
Heads in motion

[Chorus]
Hobo Santa
How’d you get here?
Your eyes Happy, Angry, Sad, No Fear
Popcorn in our hands at 2am
Us watching Him?
Watching Them?

Hobo Santa standing before us
With his wagon of books
Pointing at the people inside
They were Terrified
Mouthing “You, yeah you”
As he pointed at them
He turned to us
Smiled and said “I just like to fuck with them”
His eyes were somehow happy, angry, and sad 
All at the same time
How did he get here?
How did we get here?
2am
Watching him
Watching them

[Chorus]
Hobo Santa
How’d you get here?
Your eyes Happy, Angry, Sad, No Fear
Popcorn in our hands at 2am
Us watching Him?
Watching Them?

Speeding through Kansas
90 miles an hour
Stopped with a warning
Fast food joints
Churches
Cash Now Pawn Shops
Neverending cycle

[Chorus]
Hobo Santa
How’d you get here?
Your eyes Happy, Angry, Sad, No Fear
Popcorn in our hands at 2am
Us watching Him?
Watching Them?

Mount Rushmore 
Former Glory
Ice Road Rockies
Woke up to the Arizona Desert Sun
Coke and Candy
Got Back Home
Work in the morning
Rushed and Pushed
Through this Life
Slow the fuck down 
Smell the roses
Stop buying shit
Hug em and Kiss em
As much as you can

[Chorus]
Hobo Santa
How’d you get here?
Your eyes Happy, Angry, Sad, No Fear
Popcorn in our hands at 2am
Us watching Him?
Watching Them?
