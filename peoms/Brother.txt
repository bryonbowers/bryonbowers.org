you are the other part of me
explored the forest with you
hunted snakes
turtles
and blue jays
We built a fortress
over raging waters
stole all the farmer’s tools
saws, hammers, rusty nails galore
you were my constant in the chaos

[Chorus]
My other half
Bamboo Fishing
Sting of the Catfish
Rafts in a storms
Time now lost
as we once were
Captains of ships
In the eye
Of a storm of Hate


you beat me every time
didn't stop me from getting back up
and trying again
we were partners in crime
you beat Bowser for me
while I built excite bike tracks for you
we built fishing poles from bamboo sticks
caught cat fish bottled in a pond


[Chorus]
My other half
Bamboo Fishing
Sting of the Catfish
Rafts in a storms
Time now lost
as we once were
Captains of ships
In the eye
Of a storm of Hate



when I lost you to the other homes
each time I saw you
you were further away
each of us our own raft of chaos
not of our creation
Split up by hurricane Felix
we floated even further
each to our different worlds
but only 30 minutes away…
You found our sister
after she floated back from Ohio
saw you every now and then
we were both in our own heads
making our way in the world

[Chorus]
My other half
Bamboo Fishing
Sting of the Catfish
Rafts in a storms
Time now lost
as we once were
Captains of ships
In the eye
Of a storm of Hate




after college
you had a family now
I was the occasional spoiling uncle
as you fell asleep mid conversation
I watched you juggle work and diapers
now one in college, two more almost there
we are entrenched
in our family’s time
a boys weekend
always on the horizon of a busy weekend
we hunker down now 
protecting our families
against the of the chaos of the clown king
A storm like before
But now the captains of our own ships
Sword at our hips
sails unfurling
As we navigate a hostile world….

[Chorus]
My other half
Bamboo Fishing
Sting of the Catfish
Rafts in a storms
Time now lost
as we once were
Captains of ships
In the eye
Of a storm of Hate
