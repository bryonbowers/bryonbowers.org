A Hot Dog with Mustard
Tobasco 
And Relish Too
I wanna sit right down
And binge watch
Everything with you
Up til two
We’ll sleep in til noon
Tucked under a cluster 
of Goose Feathers
Wrapped in a Button Duvet
Dogs curl up below
warming our feet
A morning so sweet
The sun said “good morning”
To the street
Scrambled Eggs
Fried Bacon
Orange Juice
All Pulp for me
None for you
A Tiny home
Giant Dogs
One for me
One for you
Built a studio
With Rope, Lassos
An Air Gun
And nails
All hugging in a row
Troops deployed
One at a time
Still deployed
In static force
Til this day
Waiting for their eventual
Decay and Ultimate Destruction
Jump Ahead
Best case 
Human Transformed
To an Immortal Observer
Universe boiled down
To just black holes
Til the last one in the universe
Decays into radiation
Our Tiny Home
Our Descendants
Our Dogs
Our Minds
Now Merged
With Background Radiation
two trillion Galaxies
Billions of Stars in Each
Gone, Winked out of Existence…
But the Fact we Existed
We Loved, Lived, and Struggled…
To put that Damn
Duvet back over those 
Goose Feathers
In our Tiny Home
So we could Netflix
Binge the afternoon away…
That never will go away
That Fact is Forever
That comforts the soul
Information never destroyed
Only the physical
Now that we figured out serenity…
Where is that dam remote?...
