You had glasses and a pigeon toe
Joined the show for her
But fell in love with you

Wrote letters to you that summer
Expressing my undying love
You never responded

Summer ended, school was back
You walked in wearing all black
You were a freshman, I was a sophmore
your mom said no dating til 16
think your mom liked me
She just didn't like us
I didn't fuss
so I fell into love tornados
Left you sitting on the stage

Back stage glances
On stage kisses
Requiem for a Dream
We made a good team
I was a wanderer 
A jester of random thoughts
travelling and chasing the world
By the time you turned 16
we were in the same world
but living different lives

I still think about those glasses
that cute pigeon toe
My undying love inked on a letter in my best hand writing
licking that dry stamp
dropping it in the mailbox
Imagining you reading it and responding in kind
then I remember leaving you
On that stage for the last time
Our last Show we did
Our last onstage kiss
And our last back stage glance
