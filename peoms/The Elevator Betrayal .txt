I walked into
The hotel lobby
saw my family 
across the room
they were standing
in the elevator 
I started walking 
towards them
When all of the Sudden
Those elevator doors
Began to slowly close
My eyes met my wife's
Then my 2 son’s
They Looked at me 
Big smiles of betrayal 
On their Faces
And Hands
Hold Button
Left Untouched…

[Chorus]
I’m Sitting’ in the Lobby
Drinking Cucumber water
Watching Smiles of Betrayal
Between Elevator Doors
Hold Buttons Left Untouched...
Abandoned By My Family…
One Minute Ago…

The doors continued 
towards each other
I realized 
I wouldn’t make it
Sun was hot
Breakfast was out
People all around
Took two steps
Then another
As I saw 
the elevator doors close

[Chorus]
I’m Sitting’ in the Lobby
Drinking Cucumber water
Watching Smiles of Betrayal
Between Elevator Doors
Hold Buttons Left Untouched...
Abandoned By My Family…
One Minute Ago…

I was astounded
My head was spinning
I was left …
on the lobby floor
Abandoned by my Family
I was sad at First
Then Cucumber Water
Quenched my Thirst

[Chorus]
I’m Sitting’ in the Lobby
Drinking Cucumber water
Watching Smiles of Betrayal
Between Elevator Doors
Hold Buttons Left Untouched...
Abandoned By My Family…
One Minute Ago…
