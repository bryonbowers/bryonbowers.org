Upside down
On the Monkey Bars
Your Number 2’s Legs
Struttin’ up to me
Hands on her Hips
She slapped me Hard 
With a “Yes, No, Maybe”
In the School Play Yard
got it back to you
Waiting for the bus
Walked away tall
With my Head Held High

[Chorus]
Gauntlets Laid Down
Slapped By Two
I Suffered Stupid
And Shame for you
“Yes, No, Maybe”
I said Yes
Never got to see you
In Your Birthday Dress

You came in a pair
All Blue eyes
Peeking through
Your Blonde Curly Hair
Your partner in crime
Always around
Making eyes at me
With her short shorts on
and legs to the moon
Will I go to your party?
Hell yes!
I’ll bring a present
You bring your 
Birthday Dress

[Chorus]
Gauntlets Laid Down
Slapped By Two
I Suffered Stupid
And Shame for you
“Yes, No, Maybe”
I said Yes
Never got to see you
In Your Birthday Dress

Gram-ah said 
I couldn't Go
Asked her Why?
She said “Cause I said so”
I said “That’s a stupid reason”
She slapped me Hard
Defiance in my eyes
Then came Shame
It was the First and Last Time
She ever had to slap me
But in her defense
I had it coming
Hormones Raging
Head was floating
In Blue Eyes
Curly Blonde Hair
And Legs to the moon

[Chorus]
Gauntlets Laid Down
Slapped By Two
I Suffered Stupid
And Shame for you
“Yes, No, Maybe”
I said Yes
Never got to see you
In Your Birthday Dress

Next Week Came
Raining out
Everybody cooped up
In the Gym
You sat next to him
She let me know
I was dead to you
Then she slipped
Me her number
2 weeks steady
With your Number 2

[Chorus]
Gauntlets Laid Down
Slapped By Two
I Suffered Stupid
And Shame for you
“Yes, No, Maybe”
I said Yes
Never got to see you
In Your Birthday Dress
