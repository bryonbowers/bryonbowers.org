A red headed girl
A ginger freckled boy
Sitting in Salvaged wicker chairs
In a clubhouse 
Of vines and trees
Tucked into the Side 
Of a Country Road
There was a kiss
Nothing more
Berries of Blue squashed
All over the floor

[Chorus]
A Boy Logically attacked
By A Red Head Conundrum
In a clubhouse made of vines
Where Yes was Yes 
And so was No
Like a pawn
Only one direction
He could go…

A great negotiation was occurring
The boy was losing
“Be my Boyfriend” said the girl
“If you don’t, 
I’ll tell everyone
that you are” 
The boy was stuck
Between a rock
And a Red Head
Less a negotiation
And more an ultimatum
The girl gave him to the end of the Day.
He was to leave a note with the answer.
In her mail box
Yes or No...
Drawn hearts optional…

[Chorus]
A Boy Logically attacked
By A Red Head Conundrum
In a clubhouse made of vines
Where Yes was Yes 
And so was No
Like a pawn
Only one direction
He could go…

The boy of 5
Relatively new to this world
Had only one recourse
His grama.
He asked his grama
“What do I say?
I’m cooked either way.”

[Chorus]
A Boy Logically attacked
By A Red Head Conundrum
In a clubhouse made of vines
Where Yes was Yes 
And so was No
Like a pawn
Only one direction
He could go…

The boy returned
to the girl…
Carrying a declaration…
The boy was not allowed to be a Boyfriend….
Until he grew…
A mustache...
Only a friend he could be…
until that day...
The girl was checkmated...
By the Queen matriarch…
Friends they would stay…
More than friends…
On a mustached day…

[Chorus]
A Boy Logically attacked
By A Red Head Conundrum
In a clubhouse made of vines
Where Yes was Yes 
And so was No
Like a pawn
Only one direction
He could go…
