Parents Drive Off It's the Lord of the flies You walk up I can't believe my eyes Black hair in a bob Your shorts up High Your Catholic mom Wouldn’t let that fly [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone Secret meetup by the Cabin You had me flat I didn't know a tongue Could move like that Counselors walking by Hurry..zip up my fly [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone Shaving Cream wars Latrine cleaning duty Hanging by the pool Trying not to stare at ya booty I'm in a teenage trance I Can't wait until the Thursday night dance [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone Got my hair just right With a crap load of moose Gotta kill it tonight I gotta keep it loose You got your sexy red skirt with your mom's perfume I got my blue dress shirt with my shiny black shoes and something in my wallet I've been meaning to use [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone Running in woods Sneaking out to the Lake Susy’s with Brian Now she’s with Jake Layin’ on towels, trying to get dry Lookin’ up at the stars as they shoot by Kissin’ by the moonlight Holding each other tight.. [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone Last Day of Summer Camp I'm sad as hell and all of my clothes  are starting to smell We hug goodbye We say we’ll keep in touch We start to cry I’ll miss you so much Summer Love is fleeting But the heart... keeps beating… Waiting for that next  Last Summer Dance with your Teenage Summer Romance [Chorus] Summer’s kicked off The Parents are gone We’re gonna rock this place Like a rolling stone
