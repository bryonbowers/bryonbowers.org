White sweater Cold In the Carolinas Throwing down… All your Wedding’ China Giant Killer Rabbits In the Sewing room Your face is red… My heart is pounding… Holding it back… your fists are sounding.. [chorus] You call me Jerk I’ll call ya Sweetie… Slapped me so hard I lost your mind… Fight in the night Love is sweeter In the Rain… Fork in the Road Missed our turn… Gas to Burn.. and an axe to Grind.. Let’s not fight… Let’s be kind… Slapped you so hard I lost your mind… Smile on your lips… Kiss on the cheek… This is no time To be a little meek [chorus] You call me Jerk I’ll call ya Sweetie… Slapped me so hard I lost your mind… Fight in the night Love is sweeter In the Rain… Jumping’ up North Back of the van Can't put it Down That Talisman Got it rolling’ ‘round rolling’ ‘round my brain Cracker Barrel Grits Shoney’s in the morning  In the wee hours Thunderstorm’s a storming’ Pull over in the rain… No one can hear you sing… [chorus] You call me Jerk I’ll call ya Sweetie… Slapped me so hard I lost your mind… Fight in the night Love is sweeter In the Rain… [slow] Driving’ around Looking for the right place Rain drops coming’ Looking’ at your face Hearts pounding… Fast and Slow… No where left.. to Drive or Go.. Love is sweeter In the Rain… [chorus] You call me Jerk I’ll call ya Sweetie… Slapped me so hard I lost your mind… Fight in the night Love is sweeter In the Rain… In the Rain…
