I was sitting’ at the lunch table
You sat down by my side
Summer almost here
It was the end of 95
I called you “Mustard and French Fries”
You called me on the phone
We circled round each other
But we never took it home
We were always with another

[Chorus]
You were my “Mustard and French Fries”
Always on my mind
Every class we had together
a cherished honey vine
Circled Each Other Forever
Never the right Time
We’ll always have that..
One Last Dance…
Of 95…


It was the Last Dance
Of Junior High
Wearing my best dress shirt
Your Blue Dress On
Punk Dancing’ Hard
To “Never known a girl 
like You before”
DJ playing Shaggy’s “Boombastic”...

[[Chorus]
You were my “Mustard and French Fries”
Always on my mind
Every class we had together
a cherished honey vine
Circled Each Other Forever
Never the right Time
We’ll always have that..
One Last Dance…
Of 95…

Slow music on
Hair slicked back
Palms Sweating’ hard
Last Slow Dance
Of the night
I extended my hand to you
My Hands
Around your waist
Yours wrapped around my neck
We slowly danced 
Bodies side to side
Awkward bump of our knees
We laughed it off

[Chorus]
You were my “Mustard and French Fries”
Always on my mind
Every class we had together
a cherished honey vine
Circled Each Other Forever
Never the right Time
We’ll always have that..
One Last Dance…
Of 95…



Graduation came
We were top of the game
Red Robes on
In the hot Texas Sun
I sat next to you
We said our spiel 
to our class mates
Change coming hard
One last Hug
One last smile
You said “adieu
I’ll miss you”
I said “I’ll miss you too”
A great sadness in my heart
as we went our separate ways

[Chorus]
You were my “Mustard and French Fries”
Always on my mind
Every class we had together
a cherished honey vine
Circled Each Other Forever
Never the right Time
We’ll always have that..
One Last Dance…
Of 95…
