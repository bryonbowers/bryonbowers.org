She jumped up
I said no

She got down
and chewed my toe

Dancing on the trampoline
fighting a demon she's never seen

the kids giggle and shout
this is what it's all about...

shadows of leaves dance on the water
sending ripples to the slaughter

Summer passes way too quickly
Ice cream drips down really sticky

Where are you napkins
Where did you go
I'm lost without you
I need you so

Sundown sparks a toothbrush tantrum,
Fears of drills and masks to ransom.
Tales of needles, numbing dread,
Dance like shadows round their bed.

Life is a series of stories we tell ourselves
Made of Fragile eggs and Christmas elves
Live life well knowing much of what you do disappears along with you
Down the stairs we go, 
The devil’s due only you know
