I’d never met someone 
strange like me
mind mangled up
A tangent tree
Exploring Hands
Of undiscovered 
Wondrous Lands
Up your mind Hills
And Down to your Valley
You randomly called me Jack
I called you Sally from the back

[Chorus]
You Said “Meet me at the ice machine”
“Promptly Simply at 3”
“Snickers are a Dollar”
“But Kisses are free”
“Only stipulation be”
“You gotta buy ‘em”
“only from me”

Felt your heart was pounding
Fervent in my hand
I could feel your lungs 
Fill up and slowly expand
Moonlight Edges
Your body smiling in the Dark
Our bodies shaking in the Wind

[Chorus]
You Said “Meet me at the ice machine”
“Promptly Simply at 3”
“Snickers are a Dollar”
“But Kisses are free”
“Only stipulation be”
“You gotta buy ‘em”
“only from me”

Every dark corner 
our secret place of worship
Two super magnets colliding
Bodies locked
Our Minds interlinked
Occasionally breathing
Falling deep into you

[Chorus]
You Said “Meet me at the ice machine”
“Promptly Simply at 3”
“Snickers are a Dollar”
“But Kisses are free”
“Only stipulation be”
“You gotta buy ‘em”
“only from me”


When we had to part
I kissed you goodbye
You looked at me
And started to cry
I said “I’ll write you and I’ll call you”
“It’s not our last goodbye”

[Chorus]
You Said “Meet me at the ice machine”
“Promptly Simply at 3”
“Snickers are a Dollar”
“But Kisses are free”
“Only stipulation be”
“You gotta buy ‘em”
“only from me”

Wrote you letters
You wrote me back
Called you Sally
You called me Jack
Hearts on Letters
Your kisses too
Same old story
You met somebody new
and so did I
I guess it really was 
our last goodbye

[Chorus]
You Said “Meet me at the ice machine”
“Promptly Simply at 3”
“Snickers are a Dollar”
“But Kisses are free”
“Only stipulation be”
“You gotta buy ‘em”
“only from me”

[Fade out]
