2 angels opened their eyes
walked on the beach
at the crack of dawn
barefoot in the sand
smiles as they run 
hand and hand…
Not a worry in the world
just dancing….
they are dancing on the water's edge…
dancing on the water's edge...

[Chorus]
Austin
Pensacola
to Boca Ra-taan
10 hours on 
Now the bayou’s gone
fog rolling in…
navigator sleeping’
kids are dreaming
while the Sun is rising’


catama-ran on a green lagoon
half a century lived by the light of the moon
clink of the glass 
speech coming soon
back in the room
whiskey drinks with you
applesauce
kisses goodnight
shy bear telling stories
With an old flash light…


[Chorus]
Austin
Pensacola
to Boca Ra-taan
10 hours on 
Now the bayou’s gone
fog rolling in…
navigator sleeping’
kids are dreaming
while the Sun is rising’

up next morning
sand in their eyes
everybody's saying 
a slow goodbye…
one angel chasing a firefly 
other dancing in the fountain nearby
Statues looking down from on high…
Hit the road
Nestled in
Heading’ home again…

[Chorus]
Austin
Pensacola
to Boca Ra-taan
10 hours on 
Now the bayou’s gone
fog rolling in…
navigator sleeping’
kids are dreaming
while the Sun is rising’
