For 2 weeks and 2 summers
I snuck away with you
You were all tan legs… 
Prickly Braces…
and Long Auburn hair…
Always up in a bow…
you had a boyfriend back home…
But on the island you did roam…
Far away from the dull routine of home…
Our Family vacations synchronized
I couldn't wait to see your Hazel eyes
We found what we thought was a human wrist
Turned out to be Ham with a bloody twist
We played Marco Polo
You were fast
But I was faster
We kissed on the beach
every night…
Early in the pool 
Your body on mine
Watching the sunrise..
you Left a day before me
I wrote you a letter and mailed it that day
With my poem of fish decay…

[Chorus]
For 2 weeks and 2 summers
The world was just 
you and me…
One last letter written
One last letter red
One last memory of you
Bouncing in my head…



You wrote me a letter back
Said you had a new boyfriend
But you loved me too
No pang of jealousy in me
I was just happy to get your words
Delivered on paper
Surfing on top of pale blue lines
Blocking meandering words
I told you of my camp adventures
not all details included
We kept writing
Back and forth
Until we met again Next summer


[Chorus]
For 2 weeks and 2 summers
The world was just 
you and me…
One last letter written
One last letter red
One last memory of you
Bouncing in my head…


We met with intent
2 adventurers on Safari 
Each other the wild game
I was hunting you
You were hunting me too
1 year older now…
And little wiser too
I had a bracelet wrapped 
and ready for you
A cheap trinket from the gift shop
fake gold probably painted on
We walked on the beach
Sand in our toes
The sun winking out…
Our time was fleeting
every moment stretched out
Our last kiss and 
Our last goodbye
I promised to write you…

[Chorus]
For 2 weeks and 2 summers
The world was just 
you and me…
One last letter written
One last letter red
One last memory of you
Bouncing in my head…


We wrote each other often…
Then less frequently…
Until finally no letters passed between us…
I don't remember who wrote the last
Our love was now in the past
No more Sanibel Island Summers
No more kissing you in the sand…
I visited the island years later, 
and I remembered you
As I read by the pool
wondered if you 
ever thought of me
like I was now thinking of you…



[Chorus]
For 2 weeks and 2 summers
The world was just 
you and me…
One last letter written
One last letter red
One last memory of you
Bouncing in my head…
