first hot sip in the morning
goose bumps on your leg
lox bagel on a Tuesday
after a long labor day

[chorus]
1st Sip gives you goose bumps
2nd One gives you jealousy
3rd One gives you a morning kiss
4th One pulls you into the world

he's making plans
on a Sunday
While you yearn
to hide away
you wanna stay in bed
and play all day
But the world beckons 
Demands pieces of you

[chorus]
1st Sip gives you goose bumps
2nd One gives you jealousy
3rd One gives you a morning kiss
4th One pulls you into the world

you attacked me with 
ghosts of my past
your jealousy long dormant
crawls back into bed with us
murdered by the night
and a morning kiss

[chorus]
1st Sip gives you goose bumps
2nd One gives you jealousy
3rd One gives you a morning kiss
4th One pulls you into the world

we build a nest
putting every twig in place
while the baby chicks
refuse to eat
4 dinners made
3 headstrong 
and 2 exacerbated 
attempting to assert control
In a world ever changing
minds in flux
hormones emerging
patience needed more than ever
they’re becoming too clever…

[chorus]
1st Sip gives you goose bumps
2nd One gives you jealousy
3rd One gives you a morning kiss
4th One pulls you into the world
