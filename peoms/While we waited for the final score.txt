[intro lyrics] Waiting for the final score Backpacks scattered on the floor From the corner of my eye,  I caught your heavy stare Blue eyes, jeans and jet black hair fallin down to your underwear She was looking at me Like a roasted turkey two starving castaways floating lost at sea… [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… on the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… Nice and slow there’s nowhere else Baby… I wanna go [verse 1 lyrics] She walked slowly To my table This was a crazy Teenage fable She was making love  to her lollipop if she gave me a chance  I would never stop She said some words I tried to be funny she wrote down her number She felt like honey [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… On the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… Nice and slow there’s nowhere else Baby… I wanna go [verse 2 lyrics] Then came the summer, I was a sophomore She was graduated, her parents were dirt poor a cocktail waitress with a stripper roommate  Horny as hell I drove two hours straight Her apartment was bare And so was she She had an air mattress and a cup of me [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… on the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… Nice and slow there’s nowhere else Baby… I wanna go [verse 3 lyrics] She drove a black camero in a red sun dress We started for the movies Ended up in the Park she found a really good spot,  And I found hers “I’m a Jeanie in the Bottle”  Played softly on the radio Scratches on my back, She's ready to blow Cops showed up Say go home kids my grama woulda killed me  if she knew what I dids [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… on the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… Nice and slow there’s nowhere else Baby…  I wanna go [verse 4 lyrics] Parents outta town You came around We didn't sleep much Loved your touch Pickles and coffee ice cream I loved to hear your scream you were crazy as a bat, when I took off my hat Easy now as it goes Sliding on down the water spout…. [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… On the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… nice and slow there’s nowhere else baby… I wanna go [verse 5 lyrics] I had my full of the too much crazy Ended it fast before I got too hazy Last I heard of that sexy baddy Snagged two kids and a rich sugar daddy [chorus] I got her genie out the bottle… on the radio Tonight we’re gonna take it… Nice and slow there’s nowhere else Baby… I wanna go
