Morning dark and silent
Floor cold on my feet…
Faint Kitchen light 
Darkness easing in…
Cow’s milk
in a teflon pot..
Gas Turned On..
Match struck…
Blue Wind Flowers
In a sudden puff…
Solid floats to the top…
Funnel in a drawer
Pour it in the bottle
You were so small 
You could fit in my armpit
You were my first kid
I was your shepherd herder
2 acres of land to roam
You stayed pretty close to home
Except for that one time….
You wondered to the neighbor’s house
Faced down 3 dobermans
And lived to bark about it…
Your eyes popping
Skin hanging off your ass…
as you ran home
Ears flopping in the wind
Tiny feet carrying you as fast as they possibly could
grampa superglued you back together
No vet needed
A dachshund bread for the fox holes
Not one squirrel caught
Countless mole holes dug
No moles on my door step…
You were the world’s
worst hunting dog
And the world's best feet warmer
Always curled up at my feet
Woke me up every morning
Licks to the face
Nestled to neck
Lost you once
In a Mexican border parking lot
Ran 2 miles in flipflops
Tears streaming down
Thought i had lost you
Suffered grama’s wrath 
for my recklessness…
Found you there
Tongue hanging out…
Happy as could be
Left you to go to college
You moved to Florida with grama and grampa
You passed away
Never got to say goodbye
When I heard
I cried…
Not a manly stoic cry
But the sobbing bubbly cry…
of a father losing his son…
Just tears and snot
Flowing like the Nile river towards solace…
My Fritzy was gone…
No more bottles of milk warmed up in the morning twilight
No more warm curl ups on my feet at night
No more badly timed sprints towards squirrels under pine trees
Or failed mole hunts on slow summer days…
My shepherding days were over
For a while…
Goodbye my Fritzy
Goodbye my first little one
Goodbye…
Goodbye my little armpit warmer…
Goodbye…
