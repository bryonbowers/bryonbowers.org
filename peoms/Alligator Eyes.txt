The Rain came…
Killed a summer day
Lord Byron and old Cook books
My only company
A thousand spices
A hundred jellies and jams
Laid before them
For their morning delight…

Giant barrels of tea
peppered with dried
chamomile flowers
yellow and white swirling…
In a sea of black tea
my arms aching
outside play waiting for me…

Bus of crossdressers
Came into the store
grama sais sometimes
people’s insides
don't match their outsides
and that's ok
Across the bridge
To the water park

Morning steam coming off the water
Just me and the Alligators
Swimming in the lake
Before the people come
And bring their eyes
And their minds reaching out
Can see the nervous…
the sad…
the clueless…
the hurt…
and the happy…
eyes lit up dancing in the water…
I was the observer
riding through the busy bodies
Onto the arcade
Ninja Turtles, X-men, and a burger
Out of quarters
Back across the bridge…

Blueberry pancakes
From the giant freezer 
In the restaurant kitchen 
While grama chats with the cook
Sleepy ride home…
peppermint in my mouth…
Drinking Ice cold tranquility…
perfect bliss at the end of a summer day…
All my adventures I did relay…
Wilson Phillips tugging the heart strings…
Aaron Neville’s Louisiana
Melts me into sleep…
