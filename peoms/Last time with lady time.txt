walked around
swam with you in the still gray water
walked up to the line
phone rang
phone rang again
answered…
water and you floating on me…
breathing as you spoke…
voice echoes through me…
voice of another soft and distant…
finger to the mouth…
eyes locking all sound…
understood down and out to the bone…

[Chorus]
gathered my stuff
put it up on my back
your eyes said hurry and go
but your body said please come back
I said goodbye…
To another lady time…
One foot forward…
The other one too…
My body's moving slowly….
caught up in you…


there wasn't much time
birthday suits on…
the world was fast 
and so was he
you were sliding by
hurried look in your eye…
but your body did linger
as moments passed by…

[Chorus]
gathered my stuff
put it up on my back
your eyes said hurry and go
but your body said please come back
I said goodbye…
To another lady time…
One foot forward…
The other one too…
My body's moving slowly….
caught up in you…




I shuffled my feet
put my ass in gear
I could feel her nervous 
I could feel her fear
down the back stairs
put my shoes on my feet
walking now on the apartment street
I had said my last goodbye to this lady time


[Chorus]
gathered my stuff
put it up on my back
your eyes said hurry and go
but your body said please come back
I said goodbye…
To another lady time…
One foot forward…
The other one too…
My body's moving slowly….
caught up in you…
