time can turn a mountain 
to a grain of lonely sand
a neutron star to gold
elements passing
In the emptiness of space…
eons they do pass
and you know what
So do we…
living in this world
ain’t free…
It costs you pain, love, and joy…

[chorus]
Time moves
Then it sways…
your body does betray 
more by every passing day…
you are a fading memory…
housed in a dying machine…
Whose maker is chance…
1 leg, 2 eyes, maybe 3….

Survival of the fittest…
Evolution, Bacteria, 
Eukaryote to me
Complex the weaves
Gradients moving muscle
Small creatures die faster
While the Big trample the world
Dino’s had their chance
Our turn to destroy it all…

[chorus]
Time moves
Then it sways…
your body does betray 
more by every passing day…
you are a fading memory…
housed in a dying machine…
Whose maker is chance…
1 leg, 2 eyes, maybe 3….


Water Spaceship Flying
Jealousy mingled in
Shooting out
Like cum in original sin
Adam and Eve
Fig Leaves off
There they go again…
Making babies
Or was it clay
Time moves
Then it sways…
Never stopping to take a breath
Only the cold embrace of death…

[chorus]
Time moves
Then it sways…
your body does betray 
more by every passing day…
you are a fading memory…
housed in a dying machine…
Whose maker is chance…
1 leg, 2 eyes, maybe 3….

[chorus]
Time moves
Then it sways…
your body does betray 
more by every passing day…
you are a fading memory…
housed in a dying machine…
Whose maker is chance…
1 leg, 2 eyes, maybe 3….

[chorus]
Time moves
Then it sways…
your body does betray 
more by every passing day…
you are a fading memory…
housed in a dying machine…
Whose maker is chance…
1 leg, 2 eyes, maybe 3….
