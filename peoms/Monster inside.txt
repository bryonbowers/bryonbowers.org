you are my everything
you are my midnight spring
I took you by the hand
you pulled me back to land
First saw your eyes
it was only you
there was no disguise 
nothing in-between 
me and you
a comfort I did feel
I needed you

[chorus]
A wanderer was I
Til you pulled me
Back to land…
A monster's heart laid before you
My love in the palm of your hand…
Tried to push you away
But you held your ground and stayed…
Now the monster roams inside me
and on his leash he stays…

Sit down 
my lovely…
Sit down
With no fear…
I’ll make you some coffee
I’ll brew you some beer
The monster
He be dwelling
Deep inside of you…


[chorus]
A wanderer was I
Til you pulled me
Back to land…
A monster's heart laid before you
My love in the palm of your hand…
Tried to push you away
But you held your ground and stayed…
Now the monster roams inside me
and on his leash he stays…


The monster will pull you out
Deep into the sea
Sit down at my table
I'll keep you safe with me…
Take your walking boots off now
Throw them to the sea…
Take off your suit of armor
And lay down here with me…


[chorus]
A wanderer was I
Til you pulled me
Back to land…
A monster's heart laid before you
My love in the palm of your hand…
Tried to push you away
But you held your ground and stayed…
Now the monster roams inside me
and on his leash he stays…

I tried to run
I tried so hard…
But you would not relent
I saw the road ahead of us
the monster did discent…
he could not flee
you took his boots…
so he circled round
His leash pulled tight…
and stomped his feet
Then he laid on down that night…
my heart rested with you…

[chorus]
A wanderer was I
Til you pulled me
Back to land…
A monster's heart laid before you
My love in the palm of your hand…
Tried to push you away
But you held your ground and stayed…
Now the monster roams inside me
and on his leash he stays…
