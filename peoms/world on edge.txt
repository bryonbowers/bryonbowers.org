there was a man
chained down to 
that mean old ground
but he traveled in his head
travelled ‘round the world
unics versus concubines
emperor just a baby
wrapped in poison vines
the kingdom crumbled
the cities burned and cried
as the people starved and died
clutching worthless coins to their side

[chorus]
Poison vines
Fed by hate
Civilization seals
Its own fate
Words said
Are In between
followers see
What isn't seen…

the world is teetering on the edge
every nation its people its own wedge
if you listen keenly to their words
you can see the in between
you see what isn't seen
but felt by their followers
implicit bias guy feeling
racism they don't even know
in the bellies
growing slow
erupting at worst of times
creating lack of kindness crimes

[chorus]
Poison vines
Fed by hate
Civilization seals
Its own fate
Words said
Are In between
followers see
What isn't seen…


hate enraged and fed by these times
2 camps on 2 hills stand
1 fire to calm their shaking hands
only makes them angrier 
as they scratch and internal mind desire
a moment of joy from hate
would weep if it happened to us
but ok if it happens to them


[chorus]
Poison vines
Fed by hate
Civilization seals
Its own fate
Words said
Are In between
followers see
What isn't seen…

anger sadness dances
in our streets
in white ice words and sheets
fed by anger
hunger never quelched
in the end
we must look at ourselves
Will we be able to
or is kindness lost
To me and you…

[chorus]
Poison vines
Fed by hate
Civilization seals
Its own fate
Words said
Are In between
followers see
What isn't seen…
