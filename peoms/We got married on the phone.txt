We got married in India
on a Humid December Day
We got married again in Texas
on a Cold Hill Country Night
Then we did it again…
On the San Francisco Bay…
With a baby on the way…
The Town hall lady
“Said where are your vows?”
Said “we’ve done this twice before
Many years ago”
We gotta catch the ride 
to Embarcadero…

Then years later…
On a busy afternoon
Utility company called…
4th time married on the Phone…

She said 	“Do you young man?
Give this lovely young woman
Access to your…
Utility account?”
I said 
“Yes, I do
With all of my heart
As long as she turns off the lights…
	When she leaves a room…”
Then she said:
	“Do you young lady?
	Take Responsibility?
	For paying for all of this guy’s
	Electricity?”
Then my love said..
	“Yes, I do…
	I do love you..
	But when my feet get cold…
	Don’t leave me out to dry..
	Get under the covers…
	Kick that dog off the bed…
	And keep my feet warm…

The other voice on the phone said
“I now pronounce you legally bound
By the power 
Of your
Electric Line”
Expect a Bill in the mail…

They say 3rd Time’s a charm
I say 4th is even better!
I say let’s buy a farm
far away from the world
Let’s get some chickens
Some horses and sheep
And some peaches we’ll keep
Next time the phone rings
Let it go to voicemail…
