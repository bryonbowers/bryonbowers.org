I remember the day that you left A Picture by the Virgin Mary You were 14 I was 9 You made me your Valentine [Chorus] You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you You watched me  when my parents went out Lost boys playing on the old tv We drank Red Kool Aid From my parents bar I was Michael, You were my Star [Chorus] You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you I'm Digging holes in the dirt While you tan by the pool With Your Sunglasses on.. You look really cool All the older boys are flirting with you I line up all my army men they’re protecting you The Tanks are blown, The infantry’s down I just saw you  kissin ’ that kid from outta town [Chorus] You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you Pine needles on the clubhouse floor Kissin’ while the mower runs “Nothing compares to you”  on the old grey radio While you taught me everything you know we played house with your sister we got married in Vegas, you called me mister [Chorus] You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you Exploring Bunk bed caves Untying you by the old railroad I was the hero of every story you helped me build a lego tower… of epic glory [Chorus] You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you People talk and People judge But not all the people  Know how to love What an empty world for them Santa’s gonna leave some coal for him I don't know where you've been But I hope you’re loved  as I loved you then You taught me every move I knew Like when to stay and when to be with you I think I'm really gonna miss you and I hope that you’re gonna miss me too What does that little boy do if he can’t play with you
