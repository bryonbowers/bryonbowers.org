A hockey game
A fountain
The 4th of July
And the rest of our lives

She came in from California
On a cold November night

The hockey game was crowded
All the fans were acolytes

Your voice came in a whisper
The only thing I heard

Hot dogs and nachos fall to the floor
I can’t think anymore

Our eyes locked as we were leaving
Hardly know you but I need you

I thought it be forward to ask you for your email
So i asked my uncle to ask your brother

You went back to California
I really missed you

1am chats on yahoo messenger
On a dialup connection

We talked about everything
We talked about nothing

I logged in everyday 
To see what you would say

We fell in love on the phone line
I knew your heart was all mine

I was a wild horse roaming, 
She was a flower just blooming.

Tamed to a lover’s nest
We all know the rest

Now its 1am diaper changes
Exhausted midday exchanges

Family cuddles on the bed
The dog’s butt is by my head

Kids are growing up too fast
If i can only make it last

Time is not your friend
Just try to hold his hand 
As long as you can
Cause one day
He’ll be falling in love on the phone line
Losing his heart to his Valentine
