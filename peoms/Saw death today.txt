Saw death today 
Walking slowly..
Out the brick mail room
White feathery hair 
Tussled in the wind
Hands clasping
An ancient wooden cane
Old knob atop
Transparent skin
Veins climbing

[Chorus]
Death takes a stroll…
We wait and we wait…
For the beggar’s last toll
Pigeon heads roll
Crows dance their last jig…
on good people's souls

He moved slow
but didn't stop
His assistant
Close in tow
a shuffle of his feet
Vine tendrils in the street
He began to hop
Hopped like a crow

[Chorus]
Death takes a stroll…
For the beggar’s last toll
Pigeon heads roll
Crows dance their last jig…
on good people's souls

torn bread 
a casualty of war
on the ground shattered 
we are shattered all around
lives…
the pieces that fell off
death on a slow time roll
waiting to pay the last
begger’s toll
He hopped a frantic
the pigeons panicked
they all dropped dead
he took each head
skewered on
dinner for the dead…

[Chorus]
Death takes a stroll…
We wait and we wait…
For the beggar’s last toll
Pigeon heads roll
Crows dance their last jig…
on good people's souls

he danced a jig
By the miner’s well
watched with glee
as the mothers fell
down to their death
as the world did burn
all at the hand
of the clown king’s men
people stand by
and watch
fed by hate
powered now by the power of the state
injustice of one
is injustice of all
the good people stand idle
waiting for the clown king’s fall…

[Chorus]
Death takes a stroll…
We wait and we wait…
For the beggar’s last toll
Pigeon heads roll
Crows dance their last jig…
on good people's souls
