Thursday night at the roller rink
we did everything but think
lunch room clicks were not your thing
you melted away like winter to spring
carried our books like bags of gold
we did mostly what we were told
alcohol smuggled in
almost got us kicked again

[Chorus]
Pit stops at the gas station
Quarters In my pocket
Parents out of town
They lit me Bottle Rocket
You were Crazy
she was Horny
you were both a little Thorny

She played the flute like a god damn champ
Perfected it at summer church camp
Catholic school girls do it best
Come on Padre give it a rest!
She was crazy, I was horny
Breaking it off was really thorny
She said if I left her,
She'd cut off my balls
by end of semester
she had sugar daddy calls
I was free to roam
So I wondered about
and fell into you

[Chorus]
Pit stops at the gas station
Quarters In my pocket
Parents out of town
They lit me Bottle Rocket
You were Crazy
she was Horny
you were both a little Thorny


Lust comes easy and goes hard
Love comes hard and leaves you hurt
Sometimes it's in an Attic of teenage fury
Sometimes on date night after some red curry
Either your heavy with it, maybe drenched in it
Or nibbling at it 
Like a French snippet
Love like rabbits
An addictive thing
Climbs up your leg 
Then down your brain

[Chorus]
Pit stops at the gas station
Quarters In my pocket
Parents out of town
They lit me Bottle Rocket
You were Crazy
she was Horny
you were both a little Thorny
