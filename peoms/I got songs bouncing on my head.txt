I got songs 
I got songs for you
and they’re bouncing in my head 
keying off every word we said…
some are hard and fast
some are sexy and slow
but they’re all queued up..
they’re ready to go
ready to start the you and me show..

[chorus]
velvet taco…
a lick….
then a pause…
tasted your sugar… 
Kissing in the garden 
of the nordic moon…
we stayed there 
til the morning came…
then you were gone
never got your name…

a little bit a ice tea
cold sip of you with me
your mouth was peppermint 
raw flavor danced on my tongue
I am now old
but then I was young
Not a care in the world…
My mind was racing…
I thought every thought
and none at all

[chorus]
velvet taco…
a lick….
then a pause…
tasted your sugar… 
Kissing in the garden 
of the nordic moon…
we stayed there 
til the morning came…
then you were gone
never got your name…


a Marathon breakfast
on a Monday night
afterwards a slow 
dance with you…
in the garden of the nordic moon…
you were salt on a tomato 
you were fresh off the vine
kissed in the grass..
as we drank nordic 
moonshine…

[chorus]
velvet taco…
a lick….
then a pause…
tasted your sugar… 
Kissing in the garden 
of the nordic moon…
we stayed there 
til the morning came…
then you were gone
never got your name…
