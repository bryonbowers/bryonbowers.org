Oh we’re releasing the hounds
So you’d better run
cuz they’re coming for you
from night to dawn
better run
get lost at sea
go to the moon
it doesn't matter
Cuz they’re coming for you

[Chorus]
Across the seven oceans
Hell Hounds on your trail
Smelling’ your scent
hundred miles away…
Gonna capture your soul…
and drag it on down…
hold onto your love
keep your head above…

You made a deal with the devil
Bring you up in the world
You sold your soul
using hate and pain
For riches and gold
Then your body grew 
Tired and old…
Now on your death bed
You think back on your life
On those you hurt
And left behind….

[Chorus]
Across the seven oceans
Hell Hounds on your trail
Smelling’ your scent
hundred miles away…
Gonna capture your soul…
and drag it on down…
hold onto your love
keep your head above…

The priest he is praying
Trying to save your soul
But all the riches you got
Have turned to coal
Your bed is filled 
with a shriveled old soul…

[Chorus]
Across the seven oceans
Hell Hounds on your trail
Smelling’ your scent
hundred miles away…
Gonna capture your soul…
and drag it on down…
hold onto your love
keep your head above…
