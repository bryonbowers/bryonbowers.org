My Christmas Tree came alive last night It said it's branches were too dry Then it broke down and started to cry It's tears smelled of citrus and lye Then the elf on the shelf Said moisturize yourself The tree began to shake while the cookies  They did bake you gotta be good For goodness sake If you’re naughty and throw away your soul It's the world that pays the toll The Christmas tree began to dance and prance And blood was drank from Kings own chalice  with smiles of love and malice Hob goblin’s chants rang through the forest Conjuring demons and annoying tourists The bell at dusk A song at midnight Two bells to send you on your merry way Shuffle your feet with haste For sweet and scrumptious you do taste to those hungry forest creatures with ghoulished mangled features Hobble as you wobble Eat your forest stew Be careful not to fall Into the morning dew Cause world is watching It's watching you.. If you’re naughty and throw away your soul It's the world that pays the toll
