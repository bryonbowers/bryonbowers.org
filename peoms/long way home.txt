Spacehog singing on the radio
put your seat down
now we’re ready to go
Lick, paz
and velvet taco
down the drag
traffic jam
Know it well

[Chorus]
I took the long way home
for more time with you
after school clubs
and swimming too
you’re older now
living up in your head





[Chorus]
Long way home
for more time you
after school clubs
and swimming too
you’re older now
I'm gonna miss you
