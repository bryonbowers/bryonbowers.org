Forces of Nature…
Out an open window…
calmness pervades
shadows laying down…
under the old oak tree…
Quiet, Unassuming
And Grass Smothering
They are marching
for the clown king
In the streets of D.C.
Federal agents…
Forced to life 
Of Empty Pageantry
Now he’s Hand out pizza
A smiles with Oligarchy…
Oozing with love failure
No basic humanity
The weakest he attacks
While the rich and bomboozled 
kiss his ring…

2 kids are shaking
Rubble all
