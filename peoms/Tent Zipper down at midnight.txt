bikes laid down on the morning dew banana in your pocket  and I'm looking’ at you glances in the water line you took your sweet time passed you on the first day to your left next day I slowed my pace so I could talk to that pretty face [chorus] You took my favorite t-shirt Somewhere in Oklahoma Left me laying’ on that football field My Midnight Whiskey Girl met your eyes over a bad iceberg salad and not so bad spaghetti we were camping at the local  high school Tents on the football field Awkward teenage hounds Sneaking’ in the rich kid's gym Heavy on your scent  You were cool and smooth Commander of your world and everyone else's too Night slowed down… You kissed me good night I saw sparkles in the light.. [chorus] You took my favorite t-shirt Somewhere in Oklahoma Left me laying’ on that football field My Midnight Whiskey Girl You showed up at midnight My Tent zipper sliding down You came with whiskey and Thunder You were wet down to your bones You took off all your clothes There was nothing more to say smoking’ menthols I was coughing up a storm Your smile keeping us warm [chorus] You took my favorite t-shirt Somewhere in Oklahoma Left me laying’ on that football field My Midnight Whiskey Girl you were a freshman in college Just back for the summer from somewhere out east I held my tongue,  I was way too young no use knowing that now You hit me one more time Then you tiptoed out of my life wearing my tighty-whiteys and my favorite old T-shirt [chorus] You took my favorite t-shirt Somewhere in Oklahoma Left me laying’ on that football field My Midnight Whiskey Girl
